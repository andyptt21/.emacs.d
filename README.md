# Emacs configuration file

* This initialization file mostly provides support for writing literate R code with org-babel, Rmarkdown or Rnw in emacs. 
* I also use org-mode a lot, and occasionally upload to my wordpress blog. 
* I can also ssh into my OSC account to remotely edit files.
* The theme is a modified version of spacemacs light theme.
* I am currently running Emacs 25.3.1 on macOS Mojave Version 10.14.1

Mac users should hopefully be able to clone this repository into ~/emacs.d and have the necessary packages install themselves upon opening Emacs. I have one confirmed case of this working on windows as well.
