# Emacs configuration file
This initialization file mostly provides support for writing literate R code with org-babel, Rmarkdown or Rnw in emacs
I also use org-mode a lot, and occasionally upload to my wordpress blog
The theme is a modified version of spacemacs light theme
I am currently running Emacs 25.3.1 on macOS Mojave Version 10.14.1

Mac users should hopefully be able to clone this repository into ~/emacs.d and have the necessary packages install themselves upon opening Emacs
