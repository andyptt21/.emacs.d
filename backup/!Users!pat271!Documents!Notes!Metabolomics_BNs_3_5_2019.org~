* Introduction/Statistics
**** Bayesian networks are a machine learning approach that allows you to perform prediction or network analysis on the resultant model
**** Nodes are random variables, edges are conditional probabilities
**** Conditional Gaussian Bayesian Networks are most commonly used in metabolomics
**** Traditionally Bayesian networks are binary, but this doesn't lend itself to omics
**** Continuous variables can be conditioned on discrete variables or linearly dependent on continuous variables w/ Gaussian noise
**** Joint probability over nodes is Multivariate Gaussian Mixture density
**** Semantics:
***** X = variables
***** G = graph
***** P = conditional probability distributions
***** F = conditional Gaussian distribution
**** Gamma prior for continuous variable with multivariate gaussian prior for parameters
**** Most commonly uninformative priors are chosen since it biases you towards null results
**** It's important to appropriately weight your prior. A sufficiently weak prior will effectively increase your sample size
* Network Search
**** Super-exponential search space of possible networks (2^ /n/ ^2)
**** Posterior probability of graph is a nonlinear function of the graph
**** Heuristics are used to identify promising possibilities
**** Intractibility is a feature of all network methods and nonlinear modeling in general
**** Best network maximizes the posterior probability of the data
* Prediction
**** Can predict the value of one node from value of nearby nodes
**** This is referred to as Bayesian Inference as well
**** You can do forward (Parent predicts child) and backwards (Child predicts parent) prediction
**** Naive Bayes model is an example where your variable of interest has many children but few parent predictors
**** Data segmentation is the opposite: variable of interest has many parents but few children
