Metabolomics analyses are increasingly applied in the search for
biomarkers/therapeutic targets of disease. Metabolomics data pose
significant interpretability challenges, as pathway and enzymatic
reaction annotations for metabolites can be relatively scarce
cite:pmid19850466. Furthermore, metabolomic data sets typically
contain many unidentified metabolites, exacerbating interpretation
issues. One approach for improving interpretability is integration of
metabolomic data with other omic data, for example when examining
metabolomics and transcriptomics data cite:pmid26979502. Although
transcripts and metabolites do not directly interact, certain
functionally related metabolites and transcripts do exhibit robust
correlations across samples cite:pmid22355360,pmid19180179,
reflecting the outcome of simple metabolic activity, or sometimes the
end result of more complex biological processes. When combining
multiple â€˜omic data types, it is common to use pathway analysis tools
such as IMPaLA cite:pmid21893519, RaMP cite:pmid29470400, or
Metaboanalyst cite:pmid29762782 which rely on /a priori/
pathway knowledge stored in large databases such as KEGG
cite:pmid26476454,pmid27899662,pmid10592173 or HMDB
cite:pmid29140435. It is often impossible to find prior knowledge
regarding every metabolite identified in a study. For example, in the
RaMP database, 129,146 unique metabolites are recorded, yet only
27,624 metabolites (21.4%) have any pathway information associated
with them. To address this lack of annotations, data-driven
approaches, such as correlation analysis
cite:pmid29718102,pmid23246976,pmid29099853,pmid28714965, linear
modeling cite:pmid29506475, and Bayesian network analysis
cite:pmid22509135, can be used to identify relevant gene/metabolite
associations in a purely numerical fashion. However, these approaches
can also be difficult to interpret without incorporation of existing
knowledge. Hybrid approaches that combine the interpretability of
knowledge-based approaches with the power of data-driven approaches to
identify novel associations between analytes are thus preferable.

Bayesian networks are a technique for network analysis that have been
used in transcriptomic cite:pmid21551144, proteomic
cite:pmid18799736,pmid28950903,pmid22923301, phosphoproteomic
cite:pmid23825934, and metabolomic data
cite:pmid22509135. Bayesian networks are extensively used for
modeling biological regulatory networks for a number of reasons. As a
multivariate approach, Bayesian network reconstruction techniques
identify relationships between multiple analytes simultaneously,
rather than in a pairwise fashion. This is beneficial as univariate
techniques make the assumption that metabolite and transcript levels
are statistically independent from one another, which is
false. Furthermore, Bayesian methods are designed to describe
uncertainty of model parameters cite:pmid17784779, which allows for
quantitative ranking of relationships detected in the model. Many
Bayesian scoring criteria, used to build these networks also penalize
the addition of unnecessary parameters to an estimated model to avoid
overfitting cite:Chickering:2003. Finally, Bayesian networks are a
hybrid data/knowledge driven approach, as they allow for incorporation
of prior knowledge through informative prior distributions
cite:pmid18799736, while still maintaining the capability of
data-driven discoveries. We hypothesize that development of a Bayesian
network approach that incorporates informative priors will allow
researchers to identify phenotype-specific relationships between genes
and metabolites, serving as a powerful hypothesis generation technique
and improving understanding of how metabolic relationships are
impacted by disease.

*Aim 1: Detect metabolite/gene associations using prior
  metabolite/transcript knowledge.*  Bayesian network reconstruction
  algorithms can be modified to include prior biological knowledge in
  the form of network prior distributions.  We propose to evaluate the
  benefits of incorporating prior biological knowledge on the ability
  of existing Bayesian network reconstruction algorithms to detect
  gene/metabolite associations in simulated and real multiomic data
  from various cancer
  types cite:pmid24316975,pmid23376425,pmid23918603. Prior knowledge
  will include pathway topological knowledge, reaction level
  knowledge, disease/biofluid/cell type ontological information, and
  chemical similarity between metabolites.

*Aim 2: Identify transcript/metabolite and metabolite/metabolite*
*associations unique to disease state using Bayesian networks with
informative priors.* We propose to identify complete subnetworks of
gene/metabolite and metabolite/metabolite relationships that differ
based on phenotype using IntLIM, a tool previously developed by our
lab. These subnetworks will be used as input for a Bayesian network
reconstruction algorithm which will detect association networks in
healthy and disease samples, allowing us to detect and rank
relationships between analytes that differ in a phenotype dependent
manner. The confidence of these results will be quantified using
permutation analysis on simulated and real data.
