\section*{\textbf{SPECIFIC AIMS}}
\label{sec:org11ab99d}

Metabolomics analyses are increasingly applied in the search for
biomarkers/therapeutic targets of disease. Despite their usefulness
as the furthest downstream step in the central dogma of biology,
metabolomics data pose significant interpretation challenges. 
Pathway and enzymatic reaction annotations for metabolites can be
relatively scarce \cite{pmid19850466}. Furthermore, metabolomic data
sets typically contain many unidentified metabolites, exacerbating
interpretation issues. One approach for interpretation is
integration of metabolomic data with other omic data, for example when
examining metabolomics and transcriptomics data
\cite{pmid26979502}. 

When analyzing metabolomic or multiple â€˜omic (multiomic) data, it is
common to use pathway analysis tools such as IMPaLA \cite{pmid21893519},
RaMP \cite{pmid29470400}, or Metaboanalyst \cite{pmid29762782}, which rely
on \emph{a priori} pathway knowledge stored in large databases such as KEGG
\cite{pmid26476454,pmid27899662,pmid10592173} or HMDB
\cite{pmid29140435}. Still, it is often impossible to find prior
knowledge regarding every metabolite identified in a study. For
example, in the RaMP database, 129,146 unique metabolites are
recorded, yet only 27,624 metabolites (21.4\%) have any pathway
information associated with them.  To address this lack of
annotations, data-driven approaches, such as correlation analysis
\cite{pmid29718102,pmid23246976,pmid29099853,pmid28714965}, linear
modeling \cite{pmid29506475}, and Bayesian network analysis with uniform
priors \cite{pmid22509135}, can be used to identify relevant
gene/metabolite associations in a purely numerical fashion. However,
these approaches can also be difficult to interpret without
incorporation of existing knowledge. Approaches that combine the
interpretability of knowledge-based approaches with the power of
data-driven approaches to identify novel associations between analytes
are thus preferable.

Bayesian networks (BNs) are a technique for conditional dependence
analysis that have been used in transcriptomic \cite{pmid21551144},
proteomic \cite{pmid18799736,pmid28950903,pmid22923301},
phosphoproteomic \cite{pmid23825934}, and metabolomic data
\cite{pmid22509135}. Univariate methods frequently fail to account for
the high number of confounding variables in complex biological
systems, limiting their utility in identifying altered relationships
between analytes. As a multivariate approach, BN reconstruction
techniques identify relationships between multiple analytes
simultaneously, capturing interdependencies which better model
biological relationships. Furthermore, BN frameworks can allow for
incorporation of prior knowledge through informative prior
distributions \cite{pmid18799736}, helping to inform and contextualize
relationships detected in experimental data. We hypothesize that
development of a BN approach that incorporates informative priors will
allow researchers to identify phenotype-specific relationships between
metabolites and other analytes (e.g. other metabolites or genes),
serving as a multivariate class comparison technique and improving
understanding of how metabolic relationships are impacted by disease.

\textbf{Aim 1: Construct multi-level ontology networks for use in class
comparison analysis of metabolomic data.} Although functional
annotations of metabolites are scarce, chemical structure information
is present for any mass spectrometry-identified metabolite. Many
resources exist for calculating structural similarity between
metabolites \cite{pmid27867422,chemrich}, which could be leveraged for
building chemical similarity networks. These chemical similarity
networks can be fused via similarity network fusion (SNF) approaches
to pathway and reaction similarity networks, as well as ontological
similarity (such as subcellular or biofluid location), derived from
RaMP. These networks will be incorporated into structural priors for
BN analysis. Separate network models will be built in healthy and
disease samples, incorporating the same informative
prior. Significantly altered nodes between healthy and disease
networks will be identified by comparing the marginal probability
distribution of corresponding nodes. Bayesian networks with
informative priors will allow for a hybrid analytical approach,
incorporating as much biological knowledge as possible while still
maintaining the possibility of data-driven discoveries.

\textbf{Aim 2: Construct multilevel ontology networks of multiomic analytes to
uncover differential relationships.} We propose to construct biological
ontology networks based on relationships known between transcripts and
metabolites on a biological pathway or reaction level. Similarly to
the proposed approach in aim 1, we will build similarity networks of
shared pathways and reactions between metabolites and transcripts, and
identify altered nodes between healthy and disease networks. A novel
concept will be to compare the Bayesian Information Criterion of edges
between networks to identify the highest-confidence relationships
found in separate graphs. The confidence of these edges will be quantified using
permutation analysis on simulated and real data \cite{pmid24316975}. We
will then examine the network structure of each model, searching for
hub analytes and cross-referencing with known relationships from
biological databases or literature.

\textbf{Aim 3: Develop software for Bayesian network analysis of multiomic 
data with informative priors.} We aim to develop an associated R
package and RShiny app \cite{shiny} as free open-source software to improve
accessibility and reproducibility for researchers interested in this methodology.

\section*{\textbf{BACKGROUND/SIGNIFICANCE}}
\label{sec:org5635838}

The metabolome is a relatively untapped potential source for new
biomarkers and therapeutic targets owing to its downstream position
in the central dogma of biology. As a relatively nascent field,
large-scale untargeted metabolomic analyses pose many unique
challenges. Metabolomics data can be difficult to interpret due to
issues with identification of metabolites in untargeted
studies. Unlike in genomics, there is no reference metabolome to aid
in identification, and the structural heterogeneity of metabolites
outstrips that of proteins, making it difficult to utilize many
features identified by mass spectrometry [REF]. Even with correct
identifications, high-level analyses can be limited by knowledge
stored in databases with biological information on metabolites, such
as Reactome \cite{pmid29145629}, KEGG
\cite{pmid26476454,pmid27899662,pmid10592173}, HMDB \cite{pmid29140435},
Wikipathways \cite{pmid29136241}, and RaMP \cite{pmid29470400}. For
example, in the RaMP database, which conglomerates pathway knowledge
from four major metabolic pathway databases, 129,146 unique
metabolites are recorded, yet only 27,624 metabolites (21.4\%) have
any pathway information associated with them. Many of these problems
are exacerbated by performing multiomic analysis. Combining data
types allows the possibility of a systems biology-level view of
disease mechanisms, giving multiple perspectives on the biological
causes and effects underlying disease.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.67\textwidth}

\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{../Figures/Schematic.pdf}
\caption{Schematic relating input data (green, red), specific aims (orange) and analysis steps (blue), describing proposed workflow for Bayesian network analysis of metabolomic/multiomic data with informative priors}
\end{wrapfigure}

Current methods for analyzing metabolomic data can be broadly
classified into knowledge-driven or data-driven
approaches. Knowledge-driven approaches rely on previously discovered
information on metabolites, such as participation in metabolic
reactions, or biological pathway activity. Examples include popular
pathway analysis tools such as IMPaLa \cite{pmid21893519}, MELT-DB
\cite{pmid23918246}, Metabox \cite{pmid28141874}, and Metaboanalyst
\cite{pmid29762782}.  As previously mentioned, knowledge-driven
approaches are limited by available prior knowledge for mappable
analytes, which can be scarce. Data-driven approaches do not
incorporate prior knowledge, and thus include more analytes in
analytical results. Univariate approaches include t-testing,
correlation analysis \cite{pmid28714965}, linear modeling
\cite{pmid29506475}, or ANOVA to identify aberrant
metabolite/transcript interactions in disease samples. The main
drawback of univariate approaches is that they make the assumption
that analyte levels are independent of one another, when in reality
they are highly interdependent[REF]. Multivariate approaches are able
to account for this; examples include Partial Least Squares
Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) \cite{pmid30846747}, Random Forest (RF)
\cite{pmid30862367}, LASSO \cite{pmid30371783}, and MANOVA
\cite{pmid26547490}. Multivariate output can still be difficult to
interpret, and can suffer from issues like overfitting
\cite{pmid30360514}. It is thus necessary to develop a framework for
incorporating additional, non-numerical knowledge into multiomic data
prior to analysis, in order to ease interpretation of results and
account for experimental noise. To this end, we propose the use of
Bayesian network (BN) models.

BNs are a class of probabilistic models designed for modeling
conditional dependency relationships in data sets where relationships
between variables are not definitively known.  In biological terms,
conditional dependence can be as straightforward as an enzyme encoded
by a transcript catalyzing a reaction involving a metabolite, or as
complex as a multi-step transcriptional cascade resulting in changes
in a metabolite's abundance. BNs are an attractive model for inferring
biological regulatory networks for a number of reasons: as a
probabilistic model, they are designed to describe uncertainty and
stochasticity in data, and consequently avoid overfitting
\cite{Chickering:2003,pmid17784779}. As a multivariate approach, BN
reconstruction algorithms simultaneously evaluate relationships
throughout the entire input dataset, rather than examining
relationships in a pairwise fashion. Furthermore, BNs are capable of
describing nonlinear relationships that don't require hard statistical
cutoffs based off p value or differences in mean. Lastly, BNs allow
for incorporation of prior knowledge in the form of a network
prior. This network prior can be thought of as an undirected
similarity network, where edges describe the probability of a
relationship between two metabolites existing based off prior
knowledge.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.67\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{../Figures/Fig1.pdf}

B)  Overlaid  BNs  built  in  tumor  and  ANT samples.  Green edges are unique to the ANT network, blue are unique to tumor, and red were found in both. C) BIC values of edges in unpermutated graphs vs. edges in 100 permutated graphs.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Network reconstruction algorithms are designed to identify a
graphical structure that is most likely to explain the observed
data. Using Bayes theorem, this relationship can be expressed as
\(P(G|D) \propto P(D|G)P(G)\), where \(P(G|D)\) is the posterior
likelihood of a candidate graph given the data, \(P(D|G)\) is the
marginal probability of the data given the candidate graph, and
\(P(G)\) is the prior probability of the candidate graph. \(P(D|G)\) is
typically estimated using some Bayesian scoring criterion
\cite{Chickering:2003}.  \(P(G)\) quantifies the concordance between a
proposed graph model and prior knowledge. To calculate \(P(G)\), we
consolidate prior information using a similarity network fusion
approach, then incorporate the overlap between a candidate graph and
the consensus prior graph into an energy function, described in Aim 1.
We hypothesize that building an informative prior will improve the
fit of reconstructed BNs, improving models of experimental data,
which in turn eases interpretation. To develop and test our approach,
we will use a multiomic dataset generated for the study of breast
cancer \cite{pmid24316975}. Untargeted metabolomics (333 identified and
203 unidentified metabolites, Metabolon) and transcriptomic
microarray (20,254 transcripts, Affymetrix) data from 61 tumor and 47
adjacent non-tumor tissue samples of breast cancer patients were
obtained for the study. Figure 1 outlines our proposed strategy for
multiomic integration with BNs.

\subsection*{Innovation}
\label{sec:org89b0f5b}
Multiomic data integration can be aided by the integration
of prior knowledge; however, the scope of prior knowledge can be
limited, particularly in the domain of metabolomics. Furthermore,
experimentally validated reactions and pathway relationships are not
always observed in numerical data \cite{pmid21342567}. Use of
unsupervised learning to predict gene/metabolite (g:m) and
metabolite/metabolite (m:m) associations from prior knowledge for input
into network analysis can address this question.

\emph{Novel aspects of the approach and how it improves upon existing
approaches}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiomic integration of metabolite data using BNs with informative
priors:} BNs have been used to integrate genes and metabolites with
uninformative priors \cite{pmid22509135}, but to the best of our
knowledge this is the first attempt to develop informative priors
describing g:m and m:m associations. We choose to ignore evaluation
of g:g relationships, as they are already well studied, and go
beyond the intended scope of the study.

\item \textbf{Prediction of m:m interactions and incorporation of chemical structure:} 
The dynamics of how metabolite levels affect one another
are understudied, but relevant to human disease. Understanding how
known features of metabolites (chemical structure, pathway activity,
cellular location) influence associations with other metabolites can
improve detection and understanding of altered metabolic pathways.

\item \textbf{Hybrid data-driven/knowledge driven approach:} We plan to compare how
the addition of extra, relevant pathway information from the RaMP
database improves the ability of the algorithm to detect biologically
significant interactions. Rather than examining only pathway data like
many conventional approaches, our BN reconstruction tool will
incorporate as many prior knowledge sources as possible, including
chemical and biological, experimentally tuned to maximize algorithm
performance in simulated data.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\textbf{PRELIMINARY RESULTS}}
\label{sec:orgb9da93c}

To test our concept, we built BNs with uninformative priors from our
breast cancer dataset using the bnlearn R package \cite{bnlearn}. To
reduce the search space, we built models only from genes and metabolites
present in map00250 (Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism), a
known perturbed pathway in breast cancer \cite{pmid27732857}. After
removing metabolites with \(>50\%\) missing values, we found 10
metabolites and 35 transcripts that mapped to the pathway. We performed
univariate T-tests (Fig 2a) and discovered six metabolites upregulated
in the disease state, and one transcript downregulated in the disease
state (FDR adj. pval \(<0.05\), \(|log_2FC|>1\)). Next, we segregated
samples into healthy and disease states, and used the Greedy Hill Climb
algorithm \cite{Tsamardinos:2006} implemented in bnlearn to identify BNs
unique to each state. This resulted in two strikingly different
networks, overlaid in figure 2b: only three edges were found in common
between the two graphs (red), while 19 unique edges were found in
healthy samples (green), and 23 in tumor(blue).

\begin{wraptable}{r|l}{.4\textwidth}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Network & Gene & Metabolite & BIC\\
\hline
\cellcolor{green!25}Healthy & \cellcolor{green!25}NIT2 & \cellcolor{green!25}Succinate & \cellcolor{green!25}-9.38\\
\cellcolor{red!25}Healthy & \cellcolor{red!25}ALDH5A1 & \cellcolor{red!25}Asparagine & \cellcolor{red!25}-8.84\\
\cellcolor{green!25}Healthy & \cellcolor{green!25}ALDH5A1 & \cellcolor{green!25}Alanine & \cellcolor{green!25}-8.69\\
\cellcolor{blue!25}Tumor & \cellcolor{blue!25}GPT2 & \cellcolor{blue!25}Citrate & \cellcolor{blue!25}-16.43\\
\cellcolor{blue!25}Tumor & \cellcolor{blue!25}ASNS & \cellcolor{blue!25}Glutamine & \cellcolor{blue!25}-8.57\\
\cellcolor{blue!25}Tumor & \cellcolor{blue!25}ASPA & \cellcolor{blue!25}Glutamate & \cellcolor{blue!25}-6.52\\
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Table 1:} Top three arcs identified in each graph from figure 2. Green arcs were found in
the healthy network only, blue arcs were found in the tumor network
only, red arcs were found in both networks. The edge from ALDH5A1 to asparagine was
found in both networks, but was not one of the strongest three arcs in
the tumor network.
\end{wraptable}

To evaluate the goodness of fit of the model, we generated 100
permutated datasets using Monte Carlo bootstrapping, and measured the
BIC of edges in those models. BIC is a negative measure of the posterior
probability of an edge, penalized for unnecessary parameters. BIC of
edges in the true models was noticeably better than BIC of edges in the
bootstrapped models (Fig 2c). Strongest BIC edges are summarized in the
corresponding table. Identifying a strong edge between GPT2 and citrate
in the tumor data was particularly interesting, as GPT2 is known as a
driver of increased citric acid cycle activity by increasing glutamine
metabolism in cancer cells, contributing to the Warburg effect
\cite{pmid27732857}. Note that neither citrate nor GPT2 would be
included in a conventional pathway analysis, as neither was
significantly different by univariate T-testing (Fig 2a) after fold
change consideration.

\section*{\textbf{EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH}}
\label{sec:orgfc5bd05}
\subsection*{Aim 1 - Construct multi-level ontology networks for use in class comparison analysis of metabolomic data}
\label{sec:org76b92fa}
\textbf{Rationale:} Previous studies have demonstrated that incorporation of
prior biological knowledge in the form of a network structure prior
improves the predictive ability of Bayesian network models
\cite{pmid18799736}. Incorporating many sources of biological knowledge
will improve interpretability and aid in identifying perturbed
metabolic processes in a multivariate nethod. Most common methods for
analysis of differentially expressed metabolites in disease
vs. healthy state employ univariate statistics, or are restricted to
evaluations of pathways and relationships already known in the
literature.

\textbf{Experimental Design:}

Our group has developed the Relational database of Metabolomic
Pathways (RaMP) \cite{pmid29470400}, a MySQL pathway database that
includes pathways from KEGG, Reactome, Wikipathways, and HMDB. Use of
this database will maximize the chances of obtaining pathway
information for any metabolite that a network model can
incorporate. In order to incorporate pathway information into a prior,
we aim to implement a pathway topological analysis similar to
\cite{pmid18990722}. We propose the formula
\(TS(a,b)=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}SP_i(a,b)}\) for
representing the topological score (\emph{TS}) between two analytes \emph{a} and \emph{b}
where \(SP_i()\) is the length of the shortest path between the two
analytes in pathway \emph{i}, and \emph{n} is the number of pathways mutually shared
by \emph{a} and \emph{b}. If there are no pathways found in common between \emph{a} and \emph{b},
\(TS=0\). Additionally, RaMP can serve as a source of ontological
information for metabolites, such as biofluid, cellular location, or
disease association. As a unique consideration for likelihood of m:m
associations, we propose a Jaccard index for ontologies, where
ontology score (\emph{OS}) is \(OS(a,b)=\frac{\mbox{ontologies of } a \cap
\mbox{ontologies of } b}{\mbox{ontologies of } a \cup \mbox{ontologies
of } b}\).

Furthermore, databases such as Metacyc/HumanCyc \cite{pmid29059334},
MetRxn \cite{pmid22233419}, and HMDB \cite{pmid29140435} store
experimentally validated and computationally predicted reactions
between metabolic enzymes and metabolite substrates that might not be
represented by pathway data.  A reaction score could be a boolean
value indicating whether a metabolite pair was known to share a
reaction in HumanCyc, or could be weighted according to the number of
shared reactions between two metabolites in the database. Additional
considerations for a weight score could include whether the reaction
is spontaneous or catalyzed by an enzyme, and whether the reaction is
computationally predicted or experimentally validated.

Finally, further evidence for relationships between metabolites could be
derived from a chemical structure taxonomy such as ClassyFire
\cite{pmid27867422}, or from a chemical similarity metric, such as
tanimoto similarity of pubchem fingerprints \cite{pmid26400175}. 
The ClassyFire system is a hierarchical taxonomy
that provides classification for 77 million compounds. The algorithm
used to build the ClassyFire system is based on expert chemical
knowledge and describes 4825 unique chemical taxa with up to 11
hierarchical levels. The ClassyFire system is easily accessible as a
free web API, allowing for queries of the hierarchical classifications
of metabolites considered for our Bayesian Network approach. A score of
chemical similarity would record the lowest level (i.e. most specific)
taxonomic group shared by a potential m:m connection. Alternatively,
the tanimoto similarity metric is a more continuous measure 

BNs require the use of a network reconstruction algorithm to identify
the optimal network structure to fit the data. We propose to use a
modified version of the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm
\cite{Chickering:2003}. We chose to use the GES algorithm since greedy
approaches are less computationally expensive than MCMC, and partially
parallelizable. Although a variety of Bayesian scoring criteria (BSC)
are acceptable for use in the algorithm, a requirement is the scoring
system must be locally consistent, meaning better scores indicate better
fits of the proposal with the data. We propose to optimize our greedy
search through direct approximation of the posterior probability of the
candidate graph, in which case \(S(G,D) = log(P(D|G)) + log(P(G))\). In
this strategy, rather than penalizing candidate graphs for unnecessary
parameters, we penalize graphs with low concordance with prior
knowledge. It is important to note that \(P(D|G)\) scales with sample
size, so in our proposed strategy, \(P(G)\) will strongly guide model fits
at low sample sizes, but as sample size increases, data-driven
relationships will be more strongly considered. Consequently,
unidentified metabolites or those with little prior knowledge will need
larger sample sizes to be included in a network model. We hypothesize
that this scheme will work well in 'omic contexts, since even after
feature selection, the number of features will likely be equal to or
greater than the number of samples.

It is impossible to evaluate entire untargeted metabolomic data sets
simultaneously, as the number of possible graph structures grows
superexponentially with the number of features being evaluated. We
propose feature filtration with another tool developed by our group,
IntLIM \cite{pmid29470400}.  IntLim is a linear modeling tool that
detects pairs of analytes that are differentially correlated between
phenotypes. We propose to identify a p value cutoff that will maximize
the modularity of a global IntLIM network, allowing us to identify
subnetworks of differentially correlated analytes that vary by
phenotype. This would reduce the search space for our algorithm by
focusing on analytes that are most likely to differ by phenotype.

\uline{\textbf{Method Outline}}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Feature selection with IntLIM:} Subnetworks of genes and metabolites
whose interactions differ dependent upon phenotype will be identified
by applying an IntLIM p-value cutoff that maximizes the modularity of
a global IntLIM network. Subnetworks will be used as input for our BN
approach.

\item \textbf{Calculating \(P(G)\) for candidate models:} Prior information about
potential metabolite interactions will be stored in adjacency
matrices, stratified by data type (pathway, reaction, etc.). This
will create a series of weighted, undirected similarity
graphs. These graphs can be merged into a consensus graph by a group
of algorithms called 'Similarity Network Fusion' \cite{pmid24464287},
an algorithm which iteratively adds, strips or reweights edges of
each network until results converge on a single network. Once the
consensus graph is made, we use the approach from \cite{pmid24215027}
to calculate an "energy function" \(E(G)\) which quantifies the
concordance a proposal graph structure has with prior
knowledge. Specifically, \(E(G)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{e}1-p(i)}{N^2}\)
where \(e\) is the number of edges shared between proposal graph
\(G\) and the consensus network, \(p(i)\)
is the probability of the edges in the proposal graph, and \(N\) is
the number of nodes. This is used to calculate
\(P(G)=c\frac{1}{\lambda_H-\lambda_L}\int_{\lambda_L}^{\lambda_H}e^{-\lambda
  E(G)}d\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is the scaling factor determining
the strength of the prior.

\item \textbf{Learn a network of transcript/metabolite associations to identify
putative analyte interactions that differ based on phenotype:} We will
apply our GES algorithm that scores proposals based on our modified
scoring criteria. The algorithm will identify a graphical structure
that ranks relationships between nodes (metabolites) identified in the data,
preferring model proposals that best fit the data as well as reflect
prior biological knowledge to ease interpretability. The networks will
be generated separately in healthy and disease samples, and structures
will be compared between phenotypes, allowing for identification of
strong relationships that are unique to the healthy and disease state.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Identify significantly different nodes by comparing marginal
distributions between models:} Since we are currently anticipating
all input data to be continuous, each node in the graph will be
assumed to have a multivariate Gaussian probability distribution
with an inverse Gamma prior. In order to perform class comparison,
we propose to compare the marginal distribution of corresponding
nodes between graphs, which will simply be univariate Gaussian
distributions, representing the probable value of each node
independent of the nodes it was detected to be conditioned upon. These
distributions can be compared using the mean Kullback-Leibler divergence
metric \cite{Kullback51klDivergence}, an asymmetric measure of the
difference between two probability distributions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Analyze structure:} In addition to
\end{itemize}

\uline{\textbf{Validation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Recover known structure:} In order to validate the BN portion of our method,
we must test its ability to recover a known network structure in
simulated multiomic pathway data. This will be accomplished using the
method from \cite{pmid21551144}. Briefly, the skeleton of a BN model
for a pathway is converted to a directed acyclic graph representation.
Once a conditional probability distribution (CPD) on that skeleton is
defined, a synthetic dataset is generated by randomly sampling from
the CPD, with varying levels of noise randomly added. We then apply
the proposed approach, and compare the result with the underlying
model. We will apply our approach to various multiomic datasets,
including breast \cite{pmid24316975}, liver \cite{pmid23376425} and
pancreatic \cite{pmid23918603} cancer.

\item \textbf{\uline{Robustness to sample size:}} Another method for validating our
results as well as comparing our methodology to existing methods
will be to use altered analytes detected in the full data set as
ground truth, then test the ability of the method to recover these
results in smaller subsets of the data (by sample). We hypothesize
that inclusion of an informative prior will improve statistical
robustness in smaller sample size by incorporating other information
as compared to conventional methods which cannot incorporate prior
knowledge. We will test this hypothesis against a a variety of
univariate and multivariate methods, including Bayesian Networks
with uninformative priors.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Outcomes:} The proposed method will identify biologically
relevant features in data sets in a disease-specific manner. The
relationships between prior knowledge types and how they contribute to
predictions of associations between metabolites could help guide the
construction of improved future models of metabolomic data.

\textbf{Potential Pitfalls and Solutions:} It may not be possible to reliably
predict associations between genes and metabolites for several reasons.
Given the high level of noise in metabolomics data, and the challenges
of observing prior biological knowledge in data-driven relationships
(Fig. 3). Given the complex biological processes that separate
transcript and metabolite levels. We believe our modified scoring
metric may violate the local consistency requirement, meaning the
best-fit CPD underlying the data will not always be converged upon if it
disagrees with prior knowledge. However, we believe this is acceptable
because of the high level of experimental noise in metabolomic data. We
are less interested in finding the optimal underlying conditional
probability distribution to describe the data (which will be difficult
due to high noise levels), and more interested in generating a
descriptive model that contains data-driven relationships that are
likely to be interpretable in biological terms, due to a common pathway,
reaction, or structural similarity. Generated models may not be
significantly different from random models, which may indicate that BNs
with informative priors are not a suitable approach, in which case
uninformative priors can be tested, or MCMC approaches for inference
can be employed to obtain better-fitting models. It may be
necessary to reevaluate the use of IntLIM as a filtration criteria.
Alternatives could include subnetworks in covariance data across
phenotypes, or restricting input to analytes from a known pathway or
related group of pathways.

\subsection*{Aim 2 - Identify metabolite/gene associations using biological ontology networks constructed from prior metabolite/transcript knowledge.}
\label{sec:org49fad19}
\textbf{Rationale:} Methods for integrating
metabolomic and transcriptomic data are generally lacking
\cite{pmid19850466}. We propose the use of BN analysis as a hybrid
knowledge driven/data-driven multiomic integration method. A hybrid
approach will ease interpretation of analytical results and provide a
means for identifying dysregulated analytes in a multivariate, nonlinear
fashion. 

\textbf{Experimental Design:} Similarly to aim 1, many metabolomic databases
contain pathway information

\textbf{Expected Outcomes:} This will
also generate hypotheses for novel associations. These novel
associations can help guide the integration of different data sets
into interdependent networks and identify metabolic relationships
perturbed by disease. This technique could also guide new experiments
leading to the annotation of novel metabolite associations with gene
transcripts. Of note, our chosen method of calculating \(P(G)\) provides
a framework for potential integration of other 'omic types, including
proteome and microbiome, using prior information on enzyme/metabolite
relationships, or metabolites with microbial origin, for example.

\textbf{Potential Pitfalls and Solutions:} 

\subsection*{Aim 3 - Develop software for Bayesian network analysis of multiomic data with informative priors.}
\label{sec:org31a6240}
\textbf{Rationale:} Software for multivariate analysis of metabolomic data
and/or multiomic data is lacking. Implementing an R package and
user-friendly RShiny app will increase the accessibility of the
proposed methodology and therefore increase the impact of the research
on the research community. Releasing an open-source package for the
software implementation of the methodology will improve the
reproducibility and transparency of the proposed research.

\textbf{Research design/methods:} In this phase of the project I will construct
an R package and associated RShiny app for the proposed methodology of
aims 1 \& 2. One issue facing the metabolomics community is a lack of
standard protocols for normalizing/filtering metabolomic data
[REF]. To guide researchers through common preprocessing steps of omic
data analysis, and to promote standard methodology, a number of
functions for preprocessing and visualization of data prior to
performing network analysis will be included. The additional
functionality will include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Uploading of metabolomic and transcriptomic data
\item Transformation (log2 for microarray/metabolomic data, rlog for
RNAseq)
\item Normalization (RMA for microarray \cite{pmid12490442}, MSTUS for
metabolomics \cite{pmid19185549}, DESeq2 for RNAseq \cite{pmid25516281})
\item QC of the data through unsupervised clustering (PCA, Hierarchical)
\item Differential analysis, using fold changes and p values to determine
significantly altered transcripts and metabolites. Interactive
outputs such as heatmaps of altered analytes and volcano plots will
be provided.
\end{itemize}

To enhance usability, the app will include features such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Color and shape selection in heatmaps and cluster plots, to allow
for optimal visualization of results
\item Default parameter suggestions for building and weighting the prior,
as well as the capacity for custom user input (correlation cutoffs,
membership functions, rulebase additions)
\item Downloadable preprocessed data and plots
\item Downloadable code will be posted on Github for maximum
reproducibility
\end{itemize}

Interactive plots will be made in plotly \cite{plotly} to make visuals more
accessible and facilitate exploration of high-dimensional output. The
high level of interactivity and customizability will improve user
experience and broaden the appeal of the tool. We will consult with
metabolomics collaborators to ensure that a wide variety of
considerations and needs are addressed by the software. We also aim to
improve visualization of network analysis through inclusion of
Cytoscape network visualization package \cite{Cytoscape} in our online analytical
tool. This will enable users to make informative visuals of complex
network analyses to aid in interpretability and hypothesis generation.

\textbf{Outcomes, limitations and alternatives:} An interactive and
user-friendly tool that provides a standard framework for metabolomic
analysis from unnormalized, unfiltered data to downstream analyses
will address two needs for the metabolomics research community:
interpretable multivariate analysis methodology, and standard
preprocessing methodology. Writing in R will allow the package and app
to interface easily with the RaMP package as well as other R packages
for statistics and visualization (to the best of our knowledge, the
only Bayesian Network inference package in R that incorporates
informative priors, deal \cite{JSSv008i20}, is unsuitable for our
purposes). As many of the algorithms for inferring Bayesian Networks
are extremely computationally intensive, R will probably be unsuitable
for running the actual inference algorithm.
