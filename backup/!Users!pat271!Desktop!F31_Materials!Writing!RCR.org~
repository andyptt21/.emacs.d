*** Training in the Responsible Conduct of Research
As part of the core curriculum of the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (BSGP), I was required to
take the semester-long BIOPHRM 7510: Ethical Issues in Biomedical Science course. Credit was 2
graduate semester hours. The course was taught by two faculty members as well as a small rotation of
faculty guest lecturers. Classes consisted of lectures, student presentations, open discussions and
paper reviews. The course was designed to stimulate careful thought and consideration for the
students on potential ethical issues facing biomedical researchers, and guide students on how to
make ethical decisions when confronted with those situations. The class contained around 40 students
both part of BSGP as well as MD/PhD and Pharmacy students, which ensured a variety of perspectives
on different ethical matters. Grades were participation-based. Topics included:
**** Mentor-student relationships
**** Research integrity (falsification/fabrication)
**** Publication and plagiarism
**** Conflicts of interest
**** Ownership of ideas/Intellectual property
**** Peer Review
**** Ethical issues with animal subjects
**** Ethical issues with human subjects
**** High-profile ethics cases, both current and classical

In addition to this course I have completed a variety of online training courses through OSU, which
include:
**** HIPAA Privacy and Research
**** CITI Biomedical responsible conduct of research
**** Infection Prevention and Patient Safety (Non-Clinical)
**** Institutional Data Training
**** Cultural Sensitivity
**** Sexual Harassment

Lastly, my mentor, Dr. Mathe, has annual Ethics lab meetings, in which each student is required to
give a 15-minute presentation on a recent piece (current within 6 months) relating to biomedical
informatics ethics, followed by discussion. We have also discussed NIH ethical case studies when
available. These sessions are valuable as they take place in a small group setting (typically with
approximately 6 people), allowing for rich discussion of ethical topics that are especially
pertinent to our research field, such as maintaining patient confidentiality when working with data,
or the importance of statistical rigor when presenting analytical results. My co-mentor Dr. Coombes
is a fierce proponent of research transparency and has given several lectures in my courses on
essential practices for maximizing the reproducibility of published results in bioinformatics
(version control, literate programming with RMarkdown, etc.) I will be taking his Rigor and
Reproducibility course in the Fall to ensure that my research meets the highest ethical standards possible.
