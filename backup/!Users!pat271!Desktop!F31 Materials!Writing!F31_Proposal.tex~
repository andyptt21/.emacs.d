\subsection*{\textbf{TITLE:} Integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data through Bayesian network modeling with informative priors.}
\label{sec:orge729efa}

\textbf{ABSTRACT} Metabolomic studies are important due to the close proximity
of the metabolome to phenotype, offering insight into the dynamic
cellular processes underlying disease. There are significant challenges
associated with the analysis of metabolomic data, many of which stem
from inadequate metabolite identification and infrequent pathway
annotations \cite{pmid19850466}. One strategy for addressing these
difficulties is integrative analysis of the metabolome with other ‘omic
data sets measured in the same biospecimen or individual, through
statistical techniques like T-tests, correlation analysis, or linear
modeling. Integrative 'omics analysis is beneficial as it provides an
orthogonal dimension for analysis, improving insights on the systems
biology level. To improve interpretation of multiomic data,
knowledge-guided pathway analysis tools such as Metaboanalyst
\cite{pmid29762782} and IMPaLA \cite{pmid21893519} can be applied. As
useful as these tools are, they lack the capacity to identify novel
interactions between genes and metabolites, and suffer from the
incomplete knowledge of metabolite function and regulation. Thus, there
is a need to develop hybrid analytical techniques that can detect
noncanonical gene and metabolite associations in data, while still
leveraging existing biological knowledge to guide interpretation of
results. To this end, we propose the use of Bayesian networks as a
framework for identifying aberrant gene/metabolite and
metabolite/metabolite pairs in a disease specific manner, by integrating
multiple prior information sources into informative priors.

Bayesian networks are a modeling approach that seek to describe
conditional dependence relationships found in experimental data. In
their most common implementation, Bayesian networks are purely
data-driven, \emph{a priori} considering all possible graphical structures
equally likely to explain the data. In our proposed approach, an
informative prior is calculated using multiple sources, including
pathway topological information, metabolite/enzyme reaction information,
and chemical structure similarity, in order to identify relationships
that are more likely to be observed in data given prior knowledge. This
is weighted against conditional dependence relationships identified in
the data by a greedy search algorithm, which identifies the network
model that best integrates relationships found in the data with
information already recorded by other researchers. Furthermore, we seek
to address the scalability challenges of Bayesian network approaches by
detecting subnetworks of differentially correlated transcripts and
metabolites by incorporating our IntLIM tool \cite{pmid29506475}. We
hypothesize that our approach will improve interpretability over
univariate methods and aid in identification of novel and altered
gene/metabolite and metabolite/metabolite relationships in a
multivariate fashion.





\textbf{NARRATIVE}

Interpretation of metabolomic data is a major challenge that can be
partly overcome through integration with other ‘omic data types, such as
transcription. Our novel approach is designed to integrate many forms of
prior metabolomic knowledge into an interpretable network model, able to
generate hypotheses regarding the interplay of metabolism,
transcription, and disease.

\newpage

\subsection*{\textbf{SPECIFIC AIMS}}
\label{sec:org3133a0e}

Metabolomics analyses are increasingly applied in the search for
biomarkers/therapeutic targets of disease. Despite their usefulness
as the furthest downstream step in the central dogma of biology,
metabolomics data pose significant interpretation challenges. 
Pathway and enzymatic reaction annotations for metabolites can be
relatively scarce \cite{pmid19850466}. Furthermore, metabolomic data
sets typically contain many unidentified metabolites, exacerbating
interpretation issues. One approach for interpretation is
integration of metabolomic data with other omic data, for example when
examining metabolomics and transcriptomics data
\cite{pmid26979502}. Although transcripts and metabolites do not
directly interact, certain functionally related metabolites and
transcripts do exhibit robust correlations across samples
\cite{pmid22355360,pmid19180179}, reflecting the outcome of simple
metabolic activity, or sometimes the end result of more complex
biological processes. When combining multiple ‘omic data types, it is
common to use pathway analysis tools such as IMPaLA \cite{pmid21893519},
RaMP \cite{pmid29470400}, or Metaboanalyst \cite{pmid29762782} which rely
on \emph{a priori} pathway knowledge stored in large databases such as KEGG
\cite{pmid26476454,pmid27899662,pmid10592173} or HMDB
\cite{pmid29140435}. Still, it is often impossible to find prior knowledge
regarding every metabolite identified in a study. For example, in the
RaMP database, 129,146 unique metabolites are recorded, yet only
27,624 metabolites (21.4\%) have any pathway information associated
with them.  To address this lack of annotations, data-driven
approaches, such as correlation analysis
\cite{pmid29718102,pmid23246976,pmid29099853,pmid28714965}, linear
modeling \cite{pmid29506475}, and Bayesian network analysis
\cite{pmid22509135}, can be used to identify relevant gene/metabolite
associations in a purely numerical fashion. However, these approaches
can also be difficult to interpret without incorporation of existing
knowledge. Approaches that combine the interpretability of
knowledge-based approaches with the power of data-driven approaches to
identify novel associations between analytes are thus preferable.

Bayesian networks (BNs) are a technique for conditional dependence
analysis that have been used in transcriptomic \cite{pmid21551144},
proteomic \cite{pmid18799736,pmid28950903,pmid22923301},
phosphoproteomic \cite{pmid23825934}, and metabolomic data
\cite{pmid22509135}. Univariate methods frequently fail to account for
the high number of confounding variables in complex biological
systems, limiting their utility in performing causal inference. As a
multivariate approach, BN reconstruction techniques identify
relationships between multiple analytes simultaneously, better
modeling biological relationships. Furthermore, BN frameworks can allow
for incorporation of prior knowledge through informative prior
distributions \cite{pmid18799736}, helping to inform and contextualize
relationships detected in experimental data. We hypothesize that
development of a BN approach that incorporates
informative priors will allow researchers to identify
phenotype-specific relationships between genes and metabolites,
serving as a powerful hypothesis generation technique and improving
understanding of how metabolic relationships are impacted by disease.

\textbf{Aim 1: Identify metabolite/gene associations using biological ontology
networks constructed from prior metabolite/transcript knowledge.} We
propose to construct biological ontology networks based on
relationships known between transcripts and metabolites on a pathway
or reaction level. The networks can be incorporated into a network
prior distribution for BN analysis via similarity network fusion (SNF)
approaches. We propose to identify complete subnetworks of
gene/metabolite relationships that differ based on phenotype using
IntLIM, a tool previously developed by our lab.  These subnetworks
will be used as input for a BN reconstruction algorithm which will
detect association networks in healthy and disease samples, allowing
us to detect and rank relationships between analytes that differ in a
phenotype dependent manner. The confidence of these results will be
quantified using permutation analysis on simulated and real data \cite{pmid24316975}.

\textbf{Aim 2: Construct chemical ontology networks in metabolomic data to
reveal relationships between metabolites, improving interpretability.}
Although functional annotations of metabolites are scarce, structural
information is present for any mass spectrometry-identified
metabolite. Many resources exist for calculating structural similarity
between metabolites \cite{pmid27867422,chemrich}, which could be
leveraged for building chemical similarity networks. These chemical
similarity networks could be fused via SNF to pathway and reaction
similarity networks, as well as ontological similarity (such as
subcellular or biofluid location), derived from RaMP. These networks
will be used to cluster metabolites by relationships to metabolic
transcripts, improving mappability and interpretability of
metabolomics data, or incorporated as priors for BN analysis. We
propose to perform network structural analysis on the resulting
similarity network, cross-referencing with known relationships from
biological databases or literature. We hypothesize that biological
function can be inferred from chemical structure of metabolites.

\textbf{Aim 3: Develop software for Bayesian network analysis of multiomic 
data with informative priors.} We aim to develop an associated R
package and R shiny app as free open-source software to improve
accessibility and reproducibility for researchers interested in this methodology.

\newpage

\section*{\textbf{BACKGROUND/SIGNIFICANCE}}
\label{sec:org2a5735c}

The metabolome is a relatively untapped potential source for new
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several reasons: it exhibits a
close association to the phenotype, and it reflects upstream variants in
the transcriptome/genome. Metabolomics data pose severe interpretability
challenges due to a high dynamic range of metabolite levels, leading to
increased noise, and unidentifiable metabolites. One method of
overcoming these challenges is to perform integrative analysis of
metabolomic data with genomic or transcriptomic data. Combining data
types allows the possibility of a systems biology-level view of disease
mechanisms, giving multiple perspectives on the biological causes and
effects underlying disease. Many popular tools such as IMPaLa
\cite{pmid21893519}, MELT-DB \cite{pmid23918246}, Metabox
\cite{pmid28141874}, and Metaboanalyst \cite{pmid29762782} integrate
metabolomic/transcriptomic data on a pathway level. However, integrative
tools for pathway analysis are oftentimes limited by knowledge stored in
databases with pathway information on metabolites, such as Reactome
\cite{pmid29145629}, KEGG \cite{pmid26476454,pmid27899662,pmid10592173},
HMDB \cite{pmid29140435}, Wikipathways \cite{pmid29136241}, and RaMP
\cite{pmid29470400}. In the RaMP database, which conglomerates pathway
knowledge from four major metabolic pathway databases, 129,146 unique
metabolites are recorded, yet only 27,624 metabolites (21.4\%) have any
pathway information associated with them. Alternatively, it is common to
apply numerical approaches such as correlation analysis
\cite{pmid28714965} or linear modeling \cite{pmid29506475} to identify
aberrant metabolite/transcript interactions in disease samples. However,
these techniques do not incorporate existing knowledge in any way, which
can lead to the fallacious treatment of interdependent analytes as
independent variables. It is thus necessary to develop a framework for
incorporating additional, non-numerical knowledge into multiomic data
prior to analysis, in order to ease interpretation of results and
account for experimental noise. To this end, we propose the use of
Bayesian network (BN) models.

BNs are a class of probabilistic models designed for causal inference in
data sets where conditional relationships are not definitively known.
Causal inference techniques seek to identify relationships that imply
conditional dependence, either direct or indirect, from one random
variable onto another. In biological terms, conditional dependence can
be as straightforward as an enzyme encoded by a transcript catalyzing a
reaction involving a metabolite, or as complex as a multi-step
transcriptional cascade resulting in changes in a metabolite's
abundance. BNs are an attractive model for inferring biological
regulatory networks for a number of reasons: as a probabilistic model,
they are designed to describe uncertainty and stochasticity in data, and
consequently avoid overfitting \cite{Chickering:2003,pmid17784779}. As a
multivariate approach, BN reconstruction algorithms simultaneously
evaluate relationships throughout the entire input dataset, rather than
examining relationships in a pairwise fashion. Furthermore, BNs are
capable of describing nonlinear relationships that don't require hard
statistical cutoffs based off p value or differences in mean. Lastly,
BNs allow for incorporation of prior knowledge in the form of a prior
probability distribution.

Network reconstruction algorithms are designed to identify a graphical
structure that is most likely to explain the observed data. Using Bayes
theorem, this relationship can be expressed as
\(P(G|D) \propto P(D|G)P(G)\), where \(P(G|D)\) is the posterior likelihood
of a candidate graph given the data, \(P(D|G)\) is the marginal
probability of the data given the candidate graph, and \(P(G)\) is the
prior probability of the candidate graph. \(P(D|G)\) is typically
estimated using some Bayesian scoring criterion \cite{Chickering:2003}.
\(P(G)\) quantifies the concordance between a proposed graph model and
prior knowledge. To calculate \(P(G)\), we propose a machine learning
technique inspired by Isci \emph{et al.} \cite{pmid24215027} in which a
random forest regressor is trained to predict the probability of
gene/metabolite or metabolite/metabolite associations these data sources
as input. These probabilities are then used to calculate P(G). We
hypothesize that building an informative prior will improve the fit of
reconstructed BNs, improving models of experimental data, which in turn
eases interpretation. To develop and test our approach, we will use a
multiomic dataset generated for the study of breast cancer
\cite{pmid24316975}. Untargeted metabolomics (333 identified and 203
unidentified metabolites, Metabolon) and transcriptomic microarray
(20,254 transcripts, Affymetrix) data from 61 tumor and 47 adjacent
non-tumor tissue samples of breast cancer patients were obtained for the
study. Figure 1 outlines our proposed strategy for multiomic integration
with BNs.

Healthy & NIT2 & succinate & -9.38\\

Tumor & GPT2 & citrate & -16.43\\
Tumor & ASNS & glutamine & -8.57\\
Tumor & ASPA & glutamate & -6.52\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{INNOVATION} Multiomic data integration can be aided by the integration
of prior knowledge; however, the scope of prior knowledge can be
limited, particularly in the domain of metabolomics. Furthermore,
experimentally validated reactions and pathway relationships are not
always observed in numerical data \cite{pmid21342567}. Use of
unsupervised learning to predict gene/metabolite (g:m) and
metabolite/metabolite (m:m) associations from prior knowledge for input
into network analysis can address this question.

\emph{Novel aspects of the approach and how it improves upon existing
approaches}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiomic integration of metabolite data using BNs:} BNs have been
used to integrate genes and metabolites with uninformative priors
\cite{pmid22509135}, but to the best of our knowledge this is the
first attempt to develop informative priors describing g:m and m:m
associations. We choose to ignore evaluation of g:g relationships, as
they are already well studied, and go beyond the intended scope of the
study.

\item \textbf{Prediction of m:m interactions and incorporation of chemical structure:} 
The dynamics of how metabolite levels affect one another
are understudied, but relevant to human disease. Understanding how
known features of metabolites (chemical structure, pathway activity,
cellular location) influence associations with other metabolites can
improve detection and understanding of altered metabolic pathways.

\item \textbf{Hybrid data-driven/knowledge driven approach:} We plan to compare how
the addition of extra, relevant pathway information from the RaMP
database improves the ability of the algorithm to detect biologically
significant interactions. Rather than examining only pathway data like
many conventional approaches, our BN reconstruction tool will
incorporate as many prior knowledge sources as possible, including
chemical and biological, experimentally tuned to maximize algorithm
performance in simulated data.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\textbf{PRELIMINARY RESULTS}}
\label{sec:org6c67db8}

To test our concept, we built BNs with uninformative priors from our
breast cancer dataset using the bnlearn R package \cite{bnlearn}. To
reduce the search space, we built models only from genes and metabolites
present in map00250 (Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism), a
known perturbed pathway in breast cancer \cite{pmid27732857}. After
removing metabolites with \(>50\%\) missing values, we found 10
metabolites and 35 transcripts that mapped to the pathway. We performed
univariate T-tests (Fig 2a) and discovered six metabolites upregulated
in the disease state, and one transcript downregulated in the disease
state (FDR adj. pval \(<0.05\), \(|log_2FC|>1\)). Next, we segregated
samples into healthy and disease states, and used the Greedy Hill Climb
algorithm \cite{Tsamardinos:2006} implemented in bnlearn to identify BNs
unique to each state. This resulted in two strikingly different
networks, overlaid in figure 2b: only three edges were found in common
between the two graphs (red), while 19 unique edges were found in
healthy samples (green), and 23 in tumor(blue).

To evaluate the goodness of fit of the model, we generated 100
permutated datasets using Monte Carlo bootstrapping, and measured the
BIC of edges in those models. BIC is a negative measure of the posterior
probability of an edge, penalized for unnecessary parameters. BIC of
edges in the true models was noticeably better than BIC of edges in the
bootstrapped models (Fig 2c). Strongest BIC edges are summarized in the
corresponding table. Identifying a strong edge between GPT2 and citrate
in the tumor data was particularly interesting, as GPT2 is known as a
driver of increased citric acid cycle activity by increasing glutamine
metabolism in cancer cells, contributing to the Warburg effect
\cite{pmid27732857}. Note that neither citrate nor GPT2 would be
included in a conventional pathway analysis, as neither was
significantly different by univariate T-testing (Fig 2a) after fold
change consideration.

In order to justify inclusion of multiple data types in our informative
prior calculation, we examined metabolite/transcripts correlations in
healthy samples. Correlations were calculated in five different
pathways: "Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism", "Pyruvate
metabolism", "Purine metabolism", "Arginine and proline metabolism", and
"Glycolysis". A hierarchical clustering was performed using these
correlations (Fig 3a). We observed very poor intrapathway clustering,
which indicates that metabolites and genes in the same pathway do not
reliably correlate with one another. After removing duplicate entries
for metabolites and genes present in multiple pathways, we reclustered,
and noted the HMDB subpathway associated with each metabolite, which
closely corresponds with chemical structure. We observed two large
clusters emerge, one of which was enriched for "Amino acids, peptides
and analogues" (green in horizontal bar). This suggests that chemical
structure could be a better predictor of transcript associations than
pathway information, particularly if a more granular similarity metric
between metabolites were used.

\section*{\textbf{EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH}}
\label{sec:org916fbd0}

\subsection*{Aim 1 - Incorporate prior biological knowledge to improve metabolite network structural inference}
\label{sec:orgfc48e3b}

\textbf{Rationale:} Previous studies have demonstrated that incorporation of
prior biological knowledge in the form of prior probability
distributions improves the predictive ability of Bayesian network models
\cite{pmid18799736}. Incorporating many sources of biological knowledge
will improve interpretability and aid in identifying perturbed metabolic
processes.

\textbf{Experimental Design:}

Our group has developed the Relational database of Metabolomic Pathways
(RaMP) \cite{pmid29470400}, a MySQL pathway database that includes
pathways from KEGG, Reactome, Wikipathways, and HMDB. Use of this
database will maximize the chances of obtaining pathway information for
any metabolite that a network model can incorporate. In order to
incorporate pathway information into a prior, we aim to implement a
pathway topological analysis similar to \cite{pmid18990722}. We propose
the formula \(TS(a,b)=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}SP_i(a,b)}\) for
representing the topological score (\emph{TS}) between two analytes \emph{a} and
\emph{b} where \(SP_i()\) is the length of the shortest path between the two
analytes in pathway \emph{i}, and \emph{n} is the number of pathways mutually
shared by \emph{a} and \emph{b}. If there are no pathways found in common between
\emph{a} and \emph{b}, \(TS=0\).

Additionally, RaMP can serve as a source of ontological information for
metabolites, such as biofluid, cellular location, or disease
association. As a unique consideration for likelihood of m:m
associations, we propose a Jaccard index for ontologies, where ontology
score (\emph{OS}) is
\(OS(a,b)=\frac{\mbox{ontologies of } a \cap \mbox{ontologies of } b}{\mbox{ontologies of } a \cup \mbox{ontologies of } b}\).

Furthermore, some databases store experimentally validated and
computationally predicted reactions between metabolic enzymes and
metabolite substrates that might not be represented by pathway data.
MetRxn \cite{pmid22233419} is a downloadable SQL database with an online
interface that consolidates and harmonizes 35473 metabolic reactions
involving 44783 metabolites. A reaction score would be a boolean value
indicating whether a g:m or m:m pair was known to exist in MetRxn.
Finally further evidence for relationships between metabolites could be
derived from a chemical structure taxonomy such as ClassyFire
\cite{pmid27867422}. The ClassyFire system is a hierarchical taxonomy
that provides classification for 77 million compounds. The algorithm
used to build the ClassyFire system is based on expert chemical
knowledge and describes 4825 unique chemical taxa with up to 11
hierarchical levels. The ClassyFire system is easily accessible as a
free web API, allowing for queries of the hierarchical classifications
of metabolites considered for our Bayesian Network approach. A score of
chemical similarity would record the lowest level (i.e. most specific)
taxonomic group shared by a potential m:m connection.

Distilling these disparate information types into a network prior
probability requires the formulation of a concordance function
describing the agreement between candidate graph models and existing
knowledge of analyte interactions. We propose to build this using the
Random Forests machine learning algorithm, described below.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Calculating \(P(G)\) for candidate models:} Prior information about
potential m:m interactions and m:g interactions will be stored in
separate matrices, M and G, respectively. A column will be appended to
each matrix where a boolean value inferring an interaction between the
pair of that row is stored. An inference will be based on rules
designed for each data type. For example, an interaction might be
inferred between two metabolites IF a reaction is found in MetaRxn OR
they share tier 3 similarity by ClassyFire taxonomy OR they are
connected by a chain of 3 reactions in a KEGG pathway OR they share a
significant IntLIM coefficient. The specific rules will be optimized
in order to maximize the AUC of a random forest regressor trained to
predict the probability of a relationship between two analytes. It
will be interesting to evaluate the influence of different knowledge
types on the accuracy of interaction predictions, provided a good AUC
value is obtained. The relationships between prior knowledge types and
how they contribute to predictions of associations with genes and
metabolites could help guide the construction of improved future
models of multiomic metabolomic data.

Once a probability for each potential edge in a candidate graph is
assigned, the energy function E(G) of Isci \emph{et. al} is calculated,
\(E(G)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{e}1-p(i)}{N^2}\) where \(e\) is the number of
edges in proposal graph \(G\) and \(N\) is the number of nodes. This is
used to calculate
\(P(G)=c\frac{1}{\lambda_H-\lambda_L}\int_{\lambda_L}^{\lambda_H}e^{-\lambda E(G)}d\lambda\),
where \(\lambda\) is the scaling factor determining the strength of the
prior.

\item \textbf{Evaluation of probability function} A random forest regressor will be
trained to predict m:m and m:g relationships. Performance will be
evaluated using AUC averaged over a 90:10 training/test split of M and
G with 10-fold cross-validation. Rules for inferring a relationship
will be optimized by AUC.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Potential Pitfalls and Solutions:} It may not be possible to reliably
predict associations between genes and metabolites for several reasons.
Given the high level of noise in metabolomics data, and the challenges
of observing prior biological knowledge in data-driven relationships
(Fig. 3). Given the complex biological processes that separate
transcript and metabolite levels. In this case, it would be possible to
apply this approach to building exclusively metabolomic m:m networks,
which would still be informative, as the regulatory relationships
between metabolites in the context of disease are poorly understood. It
is possible that AUC values from our Random Forest experiments will not
be satisfactory, in which case we will evaluate other machine learning
regressors for calculating P(G), including BNs, Support Vector Machines,
and Neural Networks.

\subsection*{Aim 2 - Identify transcript/metabolite and metabolite/metabolite associations unique to disease state using Bayesian networks with informative priors}
\label{sec:org9297884}

\textbf{Rationale:} Most common methods for analysis of differentially
expressed metabolites in disease vs. healthy state employ univariate
statistics, or are restricted to evaluations of pathways and
relationships already known in the literature. Methods for integrating
metabolomic and transcriptomic data are generally lacking
\cite{pmid19850466}. We propose the use of BN analysis to as a hybrid
knowledge driven/data-driven multiomic integration method. A hybrid
approach will ease interpretation of analytical results and provide a
means for identifying dysregulated analytes in a multivariate, nonlinear
fashion.

\textbf{Experimental Design:}

BNs require the use of a network reconstruction algorithm to identify
the optimal network structure to fit the data. We propose to use a
modified version of the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm
\cite{Chickering:2003}. We chose to use the GES algorithm since greedy
approaches are less computationally expensive than MCMC, and partially
parallelizable. Although a variety of Bayesian scoring criteria (BSC)
are acceptable for use in the algorithm, a requirement is the scoring
system must be locally consistent, meaning better scores indicate better
fits of the proposal with the data. We propose to optimize our greedy
search through direct approximation of the posterior probability of the
candidate graph, in which case \(S(G,D) = log(P(D|G)) + log(P(G))\). In
this strategy, rather than penalizing candidate graphs for unnecessary
parameters, we penalize graphs with low concordance with prior
knowledge. It is important to note that \(P(D|G)\) scales with sample
size, so in our proposed strategy, \(P(G)\) will strongly guide model fits
at low sample sizes, but as sample size increases, data-driven
relationships will be more strongly considered. Consequently,
unidentified metabolites or those with little prior knowledge will need
larger sample sizes to be included in a network model. We hypothesize
that this scheme will work well in 'omic contexts, since even after
feature selection, the number of features will likely be equal to or
greater than the number of samples.

It is impossible to evaluate entire multiomic data sets simultaneously,
as the number of possible graph structures grows superexponentially with
the number of features being evaluated. We propose feature filtration
with another tool developed by our group, IntLIM \cite{pmid29470400}.
IntLim is a linear modeling tool that detects pairs of genes and
metabolites that are differentially correlated across phenotypes. We
propose to identify a p value cutoff that will maximize the modularity
of a global IntLIM network, allowing us to identify subnetworks of
differentially correlated analytes that vary by phenotype. This would
reduce the search space for our algorithm by focusing on analytes that
are most likely to differ by phenotype.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Feature selection with IntLIM:} Subnetworks of genes and metabolites
whose interactions differ dependent upon phenotype will be identified
by applying an IntLIM p-value cutoff that maximizes the modularity of
a global IntLIM network. Subnetworks will be used as input for our BN
approach.

\item \textbf{Learn a network of transcript/metabolite associations to identify
putative analyte interactions that differ based on phenotype:} We will
apply our GES algorithm that scores proposals based on our modified
scoring criteria. The algorithm will identify a graphical structure
that ranks m:m and m:g relationships identified in the data,
preferring model proposals that best fit the data as well as reflect
prior biological knowledge to ease interpretability. The networks will
be generated separately in healthy and disease samples, and structures
will be compared between phenotypes, allowing for identification of
strong relationships that are unique to the healthy and disease state.

\item \textbf{Identify significant edges with permutation analysis:} Since there is
no gold standard truth to measure the performance of the algorithm
with, we propose the use permutation analysis. We plan to permutate
the data 100 times, and apply our BN approach each time, generating a
null distribution of edges to compare our actual model to. High
confidence edges by posterior probability could be used for biological
hypothesis generation, or could be used as input for further
high-level analyses, like pathway overrepresentation analysis through
RaMP.

\item \textbf{Evaluate method:} In order to validate the BN portion of our method,
we must test its ability to recover a known network structure in
simulated multiomic pathway data. This will be accomplished using the
method from \cite{pmid21551144}. Briefly, the skeleton of a BN model
for a pathway is converted to a directed acyclic graph representation.
Once a conditional probability distribution (CPD) on that skeleton is
defined, a synthetic dataset is generated by randomly sampling from
the CPD, with varying levels of noise randomly added. We then apply
the proposed approach, and compare the result with the underlying
model. We will apply our approach to various multiomic datasets,
including breast \cite{pmid24316975}, liver \cite{pmid23376425} and
pancreatic \cite{pmid23918603} cancer.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Outcomes:} The proposed method will identify biologically
relevant features in data sets in a disease-specific manner, and
integrate them into regulatory networks that can be compared to those
identified in the literature. This will also generate hypotheses for
novel associations. These novel associations can help guide the
integration of different data sets into interdependent networks and
identify metabolic relationships perturbed by disease. This technique
could also guide new experiments leading to the annotation of novel
metabolite associations with gene transcripts. Of note, our chosen
method of calculating \(P(G)\) provides a framework for potential
integration of other 'omic types, including proteome and microbiome,
using prior information on enzyme/metabolite relationships, or
metabolites with microbial origin, for example.

\textbf{Potential Pitfalls and Solutions:} We believe our modified scoring
metric may violate the local consistency requirement, meaning the
best-fit CPD underlying the data will not always be converged upon if it
disagrees with prior knowledge. However, we believe this is acceptable
because of the high level of experimental noise in metabolomic data. We
are less interested in finding the optimal underlying conditional
probability distribution to describe the data (which will be difficult
due to high noise levels), and more interested in generating a
descriptive model that contains data-driven relationships that are
likely to be interpretable in biological terms, due to a common pathway,
reaction, or structural similarity. Generated models may not be
significantly different from random models, which may indicate that BNs
with informative priors are not a suitable approach, in which case
uninformative priors can be tested, or MCMC approaches. It may be
necessary to reevaluate the use of IntLIM as a filtration criteria.
Alternatives could include subnetworks in covariance data across
phenotypes, or restricting input to analytes from a known pathway or
related group of pathways.
