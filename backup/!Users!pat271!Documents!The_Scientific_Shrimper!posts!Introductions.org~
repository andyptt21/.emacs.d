I'm a PhD candidate at the Ohio State University in the Biomedical
Informatics department. I mostly work in R to analyze metabolomic
data, from processing mass spectrometry data, to performing
statistical analyses, to integration with other omics data, such as
transcriptomics. Over the past year I've become an increasingly avid
user of emacs/ESS for working with R code, building Rmarkdown/LaTeX
files, and even dabbling in org-mode. In fact, the inspiration for
this blog came from my discovery of the [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog][org2blog]] package, which I'm
using to write my posts in emacs.

In this blog, I'm hoping to keep track of tips and tricks I pick up as
I work towards completing my PhD in the next few years. Topics will
include:

- Metabolomics/lipidomics
- Machine learning
- Multiomic integration
- Tools of the bioinformatics trade (emacs/ESS, git, literate
  programming, etc.)

Additionally, I might post a little about some of my other
hobbies. These include:

- Aquariums (I breed freshwater shrimp)
- Bicycling
- Fantasy hockey
- [[https://lichess.org/@/cybersaurus3000][Chess]]

That's about it for now! Stay tuned for more details on my research
and why I prefer emacs over Rstudio.
