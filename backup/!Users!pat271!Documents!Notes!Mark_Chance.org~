* Introduction
- Director of systems biology graduate program at Case Western
- Interested in proteomic research, both basic and translational
* Systems Biology:
- Two competing approaches:
  - Pathways:
    - Established Biological knowledge
    - Limited scope
    - Overly simplistic
    - List-centric
    - Focuses on differences in individual genes
  - Interaction networks:
    - More comprehensive
    - Functional links are not always well defined
    - Focuses on modules and groups of coordinated change
- He is fighting against some anti-scientific trends for new methods:
  - Black box/limited algorithmic transparency
  - No statistics
  - Can't interface with other tools
  - Networks may not be disease or tissue specific
  - Lack of rigor (statistics) and reproducibility
- How do databases impact your analyses?
- Validation:
  - Pick a well known set of metabolites/genes
  - Pick the network to explore
  - Pick pathway sets for biological annotation
