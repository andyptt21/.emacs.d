\section*{SPECIFIC AIMS}
\label{sec:orgb0d24a4}

Metabolomics analyses are increasingly applied in the search for
biomarkers/therapeutic targets of disease. Metabolomics data pose
significant interpretability challenges, as pathway and enzymatic
reaction annotations for metabolites can be relatively scarce
\cite{pmid19850466}. Furthermore, metabolomic data sets typically
contain many unidentified metabolites, exacerbating interpretation
issues. One approach for improving interpretability is integration of
metabolomic data with other omic data, for example with
transcriptomics data \cite{pmid26979502}. Although transcripts and
metabolites do not directly interact, certain functionally related
metabolites and transcripts do exhibit robust correlations across
samples \cite{pmid22355360,pmid19180179}, reflecting the outcome of
simple metabolic activity, or sometimes the end result of more complex
biological processes. When combining multiple â€˜omic data types, it is
common to use pathway analysis tools such as IMPaLA \cite{pmid21893519},
RaMP \cite{pmid29470400}, or Metaboanalyst \cite{pmid29762782} which rely
on \emph{a priori} pathway knowledge stored in large databases such as KEGG
\cite{pmid26476454,pmid27899662,pmid10592173} or HMDB
\cite{pmid29140435}. It is often impossible to find prior knowledge
regarding every metabolite identified in a study. For example, in the
RaMP database, 129,146 unique metabolites are recorded, yet only
27,624 metabolites (21.4\%) have any pathway information associated
with them. To address this lack of annotations, data-driven
approaches, such as correlation analysis
\cite{pmid29718102,pmid23246976,pmid29099853,pmid28714965}, linear
modeling \cite{pmid29506475}, and Bayesian network analysis
\cite{pmid22509135}, can be used to identify relevant gene/metabolite
associations in a purely numerical fashion. However, these approaches
can also be difficult to interpret without incorporation of existing
knowledge. Hybrid approaches that combine the interpretability of
knowledge-based approaches with the power of data-driven approaches to
identify novel associations between analytes are thus preferable.

Bayesian networks are a technique for network analysis that have been
used in transcriptomic \cite{pmid21551144}, proteomic
\cite{pmid18799736,pmid28950903,pmid22923301}, phosphoproteomic
\cite{pmid23825934}, and metabolomic data \cite{pmid22509135}. Bayesian
networks are extensively used for modeling biological regulatory
networks for a number of reasons. As a multivariate approach, Bayesian
network reconstruction techniques identify relationships between
multiple analytes simultaneously, rather than in a pairwise
fashion. This is beneficial as univariate techniques make the
assumption that metabolite and transcript levels are statistically
independent from one another, which is false. Furthermore, Bayesian
methods are designed to describe uncertainty of model parameters
\cite{pmid17784779}, which allows for quantitative ranking of
relationships detected in the model. Many Bayesian scoring criteria
used to build these networks also penalize the addition of unnecessary
parameters to an estimated model to avoid overfitting
\cite{Chickering:2003}. Finally, Bayesian networks are a hybrid
data/knowledge driven approach, as they allow for incorporation of
prior knowledge through informative prior distributions
\cite{pmid18799736}, while still maintaining the capability of
data-driven discoveries. We \uline{\textbf{hypothesize}} that metabolite/metabolite
and metabolite/gene relationships are altered with disease phenotype,
and that development of a Bayesian network approach incorporating
informative priors will allow researchers to study these changes,
serving as a powerful hypothesis generation technique and providing
useful understanding of how metabolic relationships are impacted by
disease.

\textbf{Aim 1: Uncover metabolite/gene associations using prior
metabolite/transcript knowledge.} Bayesian network reconstruction
algorithms can be modified to include prior biological knowledge in
the form of network prior distributions.  We propose to evaluate the
benefits of incorporating prior biological knowledge on the ability of
existing Bayesian network reconstruction algorithms to detect
gene/metabolite associations in simulated and real multiomic data from
various cancer types
\cite{pmid24316975,pmid23376425,pmid23918603}. Prior knowledge will
include pathway topological knowledge and reaction level knowledge. We
propose to identify complete subnetworks of gene/metabolite and
metabolite/metabolite relationships that differ based on phenotype
using IntLIM, a tool previously developed by our lab. These
subnetworks will be used as input for a Bayesian network
reconstruction algorithm which will detect association networks in
healthy and disease samples, allowing us to analyze the differences of
topography between these networks with measures of centrality and
connectivity. The confidence of these results will be quantified using
permutation analysis on simulated and real data.

\textbf{Aim 2: Leverage chemical information to identify metabolite
association networks that differ based on phenotype.} Prior knowledge
will include pathway topological knowledge, reaction level knowledge,
disease/biofluid/cell type ontological information, and chemical
similarity between metabolites.

\textbf{Aim 3: Build software for Bayesian network analysis of metabolomic
data}. In order to improve the accessibility and usability of our
method, we will develop an associated R package as well as an R shiny
app which can be used by researchers with less programming experience.

\section*{Research Plan}
\label{sec:org75fb152}

For preliminary results I would like to use network fusion approaches
to build an informative prior for Bayesian network analysis. For
preliminary results, I plan to do some proof-of-concept for
aim 2. This will entail building networks in each prior knowledge data
type, developing a Wishart prior (this needs to be worked out but hopefully will be similar to the approach in Isci et al.), and using this as an informative
prior for Bayesian network inference.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pathway commonality} will be derived from RaMP. Edges in this network will simply be the number of pathways shared between nodes.
\label{sec:org6d1d317}
\item \textbf{Chemical similarity} will be calculated using the batch Classyfire analyzer or Tanimoto similarity metric. I currently have SMILES strings for HMDB metabolites and have used the OpenBabel software to convert between formats
\label{sec:org7e7f7a9}
\item \textbf{Reaction similarity} could simply be binary (edge if a reaction is shared)
\label{sec:orgefdc538}
\item \textbf{Ontology} could be shared biofluid or subcellular location, also derived from RaMP
\label{sec:org6159288}
\item \textbf{Genomic similarity} would be if they have a known gene regulator in common
\label{sec:org85cb2e6}

\uline{Objectives}: \textbf{Build descriptive network models in healthy and disease}
\textbf{state data to identify gene/metabolite or metabolite/metabolite
relationships that are altered in the disease state}

\uline{Ideas}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Rather than Bayesian networks, we could build multilayer networks
in aim 1 to be used for topological analysis. This would makes aims
1 \& 2 less similar.
\item We could use QTL data as another prior knowledge source (genomic). From a glance does not seem like databases like this exist
\item A subaim of aim 2 could be building our lipid pathway
database/statistic from our generic KEGG IDs
\item Reactions analysis - a subaim of aim 2 could be building our
classification of reaction types database to aid in annotation
\item Historical priors
\item Complex phenotype data (e.g. Genetic variants, clinical info)
\end{enumerate}

\uline{Questions}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What chemical similarity metric would be used in aim 2?
\begin{itemize}
\item Tanimoto
\item Classyfire
\item Novel metric
\end{itemize}
\item What network fusion technique would be used in aim 2?
\begin{itemize}
\item node2vec
\item DeepWalk
\item deepNF
\end{itemize}
\item How to quantify network dissimilarity?
\begin{itemize}
\item R has a 'Network Distance' package
\end{itemize}
\item Is there a metabolite QTL database?
\end{enumerate}
