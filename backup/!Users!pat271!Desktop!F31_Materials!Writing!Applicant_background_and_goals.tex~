\textbf{MDM2 Copy Number Reprograms Metabolism of Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma
Tumors:} Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) is an aggressive
mesenchymal cancer. Patients have very poor prognosis, with a
five-year survival rate of less than 50\%, partially due to the high
toxicity and low efficacy of current treatments. DDLPS tumors are
characterized by amplified levels of MDM2, an inhibitor of the tumor
suppressor TP53. Patients with high MDM2 amplification have worse
prognosis compared to patients with low MDM2 amplification. This
observation is recapitulated \emph{in vitro}, where DDLPS cell lines with
high MDM2 amplification have higher cell viability than MDM2 low
cells. We collaborated with Dr. Jim Chen to generate metabolomic and
lipidomic data in patient-derived DDLPS cell lines which was given to
me for analysis. The goal of this project was to identify
metabolomic/lipidomic differences in cell lines based on MDM2
amplification levels that could explain the chemoresistance of MDM2
high cell lines. Spanning the metabolomic and lipidomic data sets, I
identified three pairs of glycosylated/nonglycosylated forms of
ceramides which were significantly more highly glycosylated in MDM2
high cells than MDM2 low. This finding led to \emph{in vitro} experiments
that demonstrated that MDM2 high cells are susceptible to treatment
with ceramides. We also confirmed that the UGCG enzyme, which
catalyzes the glycosylation of ceramides, is more highly expressed in
MDM2 high cells than in low via Western blot. Upregulation of
glycosylated ceramides has been linked to increased chemoresistance in
a number of cancers. The manuscript for this project is in preparation
and will result in a co-first author publication for me. In preparing
this manuscript, I became aware of the many difficulties associated
with metabolomic data analysis, including challenges of incorporating
unidentified metabolites or metabolites without pathway annotations
into analysis. This motivated me to investigate approaches for
incorporating prior knowledge into metabolomic data analysis, while
still maintaining the capacity for data driven discovery, to utilize
metabolites without prior knowledge associated with them.

\textbf{RaMP: A Comprehensive Relational Database of Metabolomics Pathways for
Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Genes and Metabolites:} Our group has
created RaMP, a MySQL database combining pathway information for
metabolites/proteins/genes from 4 major metabolomic pathway databases:
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome,
WikiPathways, and the Human Metabolome DataBase (HMDB). RaMP was
created to harmonize naming identification schemes and increase the
accessibility of chemical and biological annotations stored in these
major databases, in order to improve coverage of experimental data. I
helped develop the RaMP R package, which allows users to query the
database, perform pathway analysis, and cluster pathway analysis
results. The R package is also useful for integrating with other
R-based metabolomic data analysis tools. I also helped build the
associated RShiny app, a web-based tool that makes the functionality
of the RaMP package accessible to users with no programming
knowledge. The RaMP database will serve as a source of pathway,
biofluid ontology, disease ontology, and reaction knowledge for the
informative priors in my proposal, and we have plans to expand the
knowledge in the database to include chemical structure information as
well in the form of InChIKeys. My work on RaMP has resulted in a
textbook chapter and a second author publication.

\textbf{Planned Dissertation:} My projects up to this point made me aware of
some of the challenges of interpreting metabolomic data, as well as
the importance of organizing and improving the availability of the
prior knowledge that is available for metabolomic data.  To address
these issues, the main goal for my doctoral dissertation is to improve
the sensitivity of metabolomic and lipidomic pathway analysis. I plan
to achieve this by developing a database for performing lipidomic
pathway analysis that combines information from multiple lipidomic
databases, and allows for overrepresentation analysis (ORA) that addresses
the differences in structural resolution between databases. I also
intend to develop new methodology for analyzing lipidomic and
metabolomic data that leverages prior knowledge while still allowing
for novel data-driven discovery of analytes and analyte relationships
altered by disease phenotype, such as cancer. High-throughput 'omic
data is expensive and difficult to obtain and interpret. Many analyses
do not make efficient use of this data, either by ignoring complex
biological interdependencies that explain experimental data, or by
ignoring analytes which have no prior knowledge associated with
them. The focuses of my research will be to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Build methodology for incorporating a variety of biological and
chemical annotations into consensus similarity networks of
metabolites.
\item Apply the cross talker algorithm to identify modules of
metabolites with coordinated regulatory patterns specific to phenotype.
\item Perform ORA to identify biological processes associated with
dysregulated metabolite modules.
\item Compare my proposed methodology to a existing
ORA methodology, such as the Fisher's Exact test, or Metabolite
Set enrichment analysis, in real and simulated data, to
demonstrate increased capacity for detecting pathways altered
in tandem with phenotype.
\item Develop software that makes the approach accessible to
researchers.
\end{enumerate}
As mass-spectrometry or NMR generated data become more
abundant, more sophisticated analytical techniques will become
necessary to make sense of the underlying biology. My novel method
will improve coverage of analytes in analyses, as it will incorporate
all possible prior knowledge while still including analytes for which
no prior knowledge is available. My research and training in
metabolomics work as well as my participation in the development
of RaMP, which will serve as a rich source of biological knowledge for
my project, have ideally situated me to complete this project.

\uline{\textbf{Previous Research Experiences}}

\textbf{Undergraduate Research:} In my undergraduate studies at SUNY Geneseo I
developed an interest in statistics and programming, which lead me to
complete a biomathematics minor in addition to my Biochemistry
major. This minor required upper level math courses, as well as
biological statistics and modeling courses which required a working
knowledge of the R programming language. To develop my R programming
skills, during my sophomore and junior years I participated in an
informal research group led by Dr. Gregg Hartvigsen, who instructed us
in basic modeling techniques using R, such as modeling the spread of
disease through a population using networks or differential
equations. Dr. Hartvigsen was an outstanding instructor for instilling
a curiosity for research and demonstrating the potential of
programming for answering biological questions. During my senior year
I participated in research in the lab of Dr. Isidro Bosch, who was
interested in identifying unknown starfish larvae samples using
targeted sequencing of the RuBisCO gene in symbiotic cyanobacteria
found in the samples. Results were inconclusive.

\textbf{Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at University at Buffalo}: As
my undergraduate institution was relatively small I also looked
extramurally for research opportunities. I thus participated in the
Summer Undergraduate Research Fellows program at University at Buffalo
in the summer following my junior year, funded by the American Society
for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. During this two-month
experience, I worked in the lab of Dr. Marilyn Morris, examining
sex-dependent differences in MCT1 expression in rat tissues, to better
understand sex-dependent differences in metabolism of gamma
hydroxybutyrate, a substrate of the MCT1 protein. We identified a
\textasciitilde{}2-fold increase in expression of MCT1 in the liver of males compared
to females, which may indicate a sex hormone-dependent effect on MCT1
expression. In addition to research, we were required to attend
training in basic laboratory techniques and animal handling, and
regular talks from the faculty at UB, as well as a weekly workshop for
oral presentations. At the conclusion of the experience, we were
required to give a 20-minute talk with 5 minutes of questions as well
as a poster presentation. Due to the small sample size of the
experiment (N=3), results were not published. Outside of my project, I
was particularly interested in the pharmacokinetic modeling work of
the graduate students in the lab, which furthered my interest in
performing computational work in graduate school.

\textbf{National Institutes of Health}: Following my undergraduate education, I
was accepted into the postbaccalaureate fellows program in the lab of
Dr. Michael Ombrello in the National Institute of Arthritis and
Musculoskeletal and Skin diseases (NIAMS), where I worked for one year
on identification of ultra-rare genetic variants associated with
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). sJIA is a form of
childhood arthritis that develops in \textasciitilde{}1/100,000 children each
year. sJIA is a genetically complex inflammatory disease, but we do
not understand its etiology or genetic risk factors. Using a Targeted
Deep Resequencing pipeline with a genetically matched collection of
587/401 cases/controls and an ensemble of statistical tests for
determining association with phenotype in extremely low frequency
variants, we identified variants in 7 different genes associated with
sJIA, including previously reported sJIA-associated genes (\emph{IL36G},
\emph{IL18RAP}), genes implicated as GWAS candidate loci in a parallel study
(\emph{RIN3}, \emph{THAP10}, \emph{ART4}), and a gene associated with hereditary periodic
fever syndrome (\emph{IL1RN}), a related condition. My research was
approximately 20\% wet lab (DNA extraction and library preparation) and
80\% computational (alignment/variant calling/annotation on the
supercomputing cluster and statistical analysis with R). Due to the
relative brevity of my time spent in Dr. Ombrello's lab, no
publication was produced. However, the experience was very valuable
for me to develop my R programming skills and continue my wet lab
training, as well as gaining experience with supercomputing, and
participating in the excellent journal clubs and bioinformatics
seminars offered at the NIH. I was also able to continue my education
through night classes at the Foundation for Advanced Education, where
I learned more about general bioinformatics concepts as well as gained
basic proficiency in the Python coding language. At the end of the
year I presented my work at Postbac Poster Day as well as the NIAMS
retreat, where I won an award for best poster.

\section*{B) Training Goals and Objectives}
\label{sec:org017d19a}
The first goal of my activity during this fellowship will be to
develop an integrative lipidomics pathway database as an extension to
the RaMP database developed by our group. The database will include an
associated R package for ORA of lipid
pathways, as well as a user-friendly interface. The approach will be
tested on a variety of real and simulated lipid data sets to
demonstrate the increased capacity of the approach to detect altered
lipid pathways. The second goal of my activity during this fellowship
will be to rigorously evaluate the proposed similarity network fusion
methodology in a variety of real and simulated data sets,
demonstrating it's capacity to detect biologically relevant pathways
that are not detected by conventional methodology. The results will be
summarized in a manuscript to be submitted in high-impact
metabolomic/bioinformatics journals such as \emph{Metabolomics} or \emph{BMC
Bioinformatics}. The publication will be accompanied by an open-source
R-package and RShiny app, as well as example data sets to ensure
maximum reproducibility of findings. If successful, this framework
could be extended beyond the metabolomics/lipidomics context, and be
applied to many different types of omics data, provided that there is
prior information available that could be integrated into a consensus
similarity network.

This fellowship would allow me to continue my education both in the
classroom as well as in a computational research setting. In my
training I hope to gain greater experience in advanced R programming
topics such as package development and R shiny development. To this
end I plan on attending future meetings of the BioConductor conference
series, where leading bioinformaticians provide workshops for best
practices in R package development as well as sharing their work in
open source bioinformatics software development. Further, being the
primary investigator on an R package/RShiny development project would
be highly beneficial in helping me attain all the skills needed to be
a consummate R developer, such as use of the devtools package,
performing run time analysis, and maintaining/updating the package
following release. In order to learn more about networks and their
applications in computational biology, I also intend to attend more
computationally oriented workshops such as the Canadian Bioinformatics
Workshop series, the West Coast metabolomics center workshop series,
the Translational Data Analytics Institute at Ohio State,
or the Cold Spring Harbor Metabolomics course, as well as more
computationally oriented conferences, such as the International
Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology series (BICOB
or GLBIO).

This fellowship would also afford me more free time to devote to
independent study of other languages using online resources such as
Codecademy and DataCamp. I also intend to improve my understanding of
techniques and practices in machine learning, both through online
courses such as the Coursera courses taught by Andrew Ng (Machine
Learning) and Daphne Koller (Probabilistic Graph Models), as well as
through a future course at OSU taught by my co-sponsors Dr. Mathe and
Dr. Coombes, Machine Learning for Bioinformatics. Increasing the
breadth and depth of my programming knowledge will be essential for
future projects later in my career to continue to create innovative
software that is valuable to the research community.

During the course of the award I will be able to benefit immensely
from the support of my interdisciplinary mentorship team. My primary
mentor, Dr. Mathe, is an experienced metabolomics expert and
bioinformatician who has and will continue to mentor me in all aspects
of metabolomics research, from experimental design and data generation
to analysis and interpretation. She has also contributed to multiple R
packages/Shiny apps and MySQL databases, and has helped me learn other
skills necessary for collaborative software development. My co-sponsor
Dr. Coombes is an accomplished statistician as well as an advocate for
reproducible research. His input on my project as well as his courses
(Rigor and Reproducibility \& Machine Learning) will be strong assets
for my research in guiding my research questions and leading to
scientifically robust and valid results. My other committee members
Dr. Kopec and Dr. Li were also chosen due to their relevant areas of
expertise to my proposal. Dr. Kopec is a metabolomics expert who has
collaborated with our group and served as a resource to improve my
biological understanding of metabolomics data. She and Dr. Mathe have
allowed me to sit in on their Metabolomics course (Spring 2019), which
has further increased my understanding of current trends and
techniques in metabolomics research. Dr. Li's group has hosted me at
their lab meetings to critique some of my thesis ideas. This has lead
to many fruitful discussions of my research ideas, and has a high
potential for scientific collaboration in the future, particularly in
the software development area.

Following my graduate training, I intend to obtain a post-doctoral
position in a lab that will help me continue my training towards my
ultimate goal of becoming a computational metabolomics researcher,
such as the lab of Dr. Oliver Fiehn at UC Davis, David Wishart at the
University of Alberta, or Dr. Gary Siuzdak at the Scripps Research
Institute. To support my postdoctoral research I plan to apply for
further funding through an F32 or K series award. Successful
completion of the aims of this proposal would be a tremendous asset
towards giving me the skills needed to be an independent, rigorous and
reproducible researcher following my graduation from OSU. In the long
term, I hope to lead my own group in computational metabolomics
research, following the example of the many talented and passionate
computational biologists I worked with at the NIH as well as here at
OSU. I have constructed my research goals at OSU to give me the skills
necessary to accomplish this later in my career. As a relatively
unstudied field, there are major computational challenges that remain
unsolved in analyzing and interpreting metabolomic data, with much
work to be done in characterizing new metabolites and their functions,
developing data normalization and statistical methods, increasing
reproducibility, and refining pathway analysis tools. Given my
training and research in computational biology and metabolomics, I am
excited to make my contribution to this growing field.
