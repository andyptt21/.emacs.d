\section*{A) Doctoral Dissertation and Research Experience}
\label{sec:org8b6a61a}

\uline{\textbf{Previous Research Experiences}}

\textbf{Undergraduate Research:} In my undergraduate studies at SUNY Geneseo I
began as a biology major, unsure of what subdiscipline I was
interested in pursuing. Luckily, in my freshman year I took an Ecology
course taught by Dr. Gregg Hartvigsen, who heavily emphasized the
statistical/mathematical modeling aspects of ecology, and required a
basic proficiency in the R programming language by the time the course
was completed. This course lead me to realize I had an interest in
statistics and programming, which lead me to complete a
biomathematics minor, requiring me to take upper level math courses,
as well as biological statistics and modeling courses. To further
develop my budding programming skills, during my sophomore and junior
years I participated in an informal research group led by the same Dr.
Hartvigsen, who further instructed us in basic modeling techniques
using R, such as modeling the spread of disease through a population
using networks or differential equations. Dr. Hartvigsen was an
outstanding instructor for instilling a curiosity for research and
demonstrating the potential of programming for answering biological
questions. I also began to develop an interest in chemistry following
my organic chemistry courses in my sophomore year, which prompted me
to switch my major from biology to biochemistry. To develop my wet lab
skills in parallel with my programming abilities, during my senior
year I participated in research in the lab of Dr. Isidro Bosch, who
was interested in identifying unknown starfish larvae samples using
targeted sequencing of the RuBisCO gene in symbiotic cyanobacteria
found in the samples. For this same reason I also sought out a summer
research experience following my junior year. As I was still unsure
exactly what subdiscipline I was interested in, I applied to a wide
variety of environmental science/bioinformatics/pharmaceutical science
research experiences for undergraduates. I was thrilled to be accepted
into the University at Buffalo Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship.

\textbf{Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at University at Buffalo}: 
My research experience at University at Buffalo was a two-month
program funded by the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental
Therapeutics. During this experience, I worked in the lab of
Dr. Marilyn Morris, examining sex-dependent differences in MCT1
expression in rat tissues, to better understand sex-dependent
differences in metabolism of gamma hydroxybutyrate, a substrate of the
MCT1 protein. We identified a \textasciitilde{}2-fold increase in expression of MCT1
in the liver of males compared to females, which may indicate a sex
hormone-dependent effect on MCT1 expression. In addition to research,
we were required to attend training in basic laboratory techniques and
animal handling, and regular talks from the faculty at UB, as well as
a weekly workshop for oral presentations. At the conclusion of the
experience, we were required to give a 20-minute talk with 5 minutes
of questions as well as a poster presentation. Due to the small sample
size of the experiment (N=3), results were not published. My work in
Buffalo made me realize that I enjoyed the prospect of using my
biochemistry knowledge to positively impact human health. Outside of
my project, I was also particularly interested in the pharmacokinetic
modeling work of the graduate students in the lab, which furthered my
interest in performing computational work in graduate school. Although
I was becoming more certain that computational biology was my calling,
by the time I graduated from SUNY Geneseo, I had never had the
opportunity to participate in computational biology research in a
biomedical setting. For this reason, I decided to apply for a 
postbaccalaureate research experience at the National Institutes of
Health focusing on bioinformatics.

\textbf{National Institutes of Health}: I was happy to be accepted into the
postbaccalaureate fellows program in the lab of Dr. Michael Ombrello
in the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin
diseases (NIAMS), where I worked for one year on identification of
ultra-rare genetic variants associated with systemic juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). sJIA is a form of childhood arthritis
that develops in \textasciitilde{}1/100,000 children each year. sJIA is a genetically
complex inflammatory disease, but we do not understand its etiology or
genetic risk factors. Using a Targeted Deep Resequencing pipeline with
a genetically matched collection of 587/401 cases/controls and an
ensemble of statistical tests for determining association with
phenotype in extremely low frequency variants, we identified variants
in 7 different genes associated with sJIA, including previously
reported sJIA-associated genes (\emph{IL36G}, \emph{IL18RAP}), genes implicated as
GWAS candidate loci in a parallel study (\emph{RIN3}, \emph{THAP10}, \emph{ART4}), and a
gene associated with hereditary periodic fever syndrome (\emph{IL1RN}), a
related condition. My research was approximately 20\% wet lab (DNA
extraction and library preparation) and 80\% computational
(alignment/variant calling/annotation on the supercomputing cluster
and statistical analysis with R). Due to the relative brevity of my
time spent in Dr. Ombrello's lab, no publication was
produced. However, the experience was very valuable for me to develop
my R programming skills and continue my wet lab training, as well as
gaining experience with supercomputing, and participating in the
excellent journal clubs and bioinformatics seminars offered at the
NIH. I was also able to continue my education through night classes at
the Foundation for Advanced Education, where I learned more about
general bioinformatics concepts as well as gained basic proficiency in
the Python coding language. At the end of the year I presented my work
on rare variants associated with sJIA at Postbac Poster Day as well as
the NIAMS retreat, where I won an award for best poster. This year
strengthened my resolve to pursue graduate work in computational
biology, so I applied to a variety of different bioinformatics PhD
programs. I was most intrigued by the untargeted metabolomics work being done by
Dr. Ewy Mathe at The Ohio State University, as I felt it was a unique
opportunity to leverage the skills I had developed in computational
biology as well as biochemistry. Thus, when I was accepted into the
Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, I was allowed to join her lab
straight away, waiving the lab rotation period that most new students
participated in.

\textbf{MDM2 Copy Number Reprograms Metabolism of Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma
Tumors:} Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) is an aggressive
mesenchymal cancer. Patients have very poor prognosis, with a
five-year survival rate of less than 50\%, partially due to the high
toxicity and low efficacy of current treatments. DDLPS tumors are
characterized by amplified levels of MDM2, an inhibitor of the tumor
suppressor TP53. Patients with high MDM2 amplification have worse
prognosis compared to patients with low MDM2 amplification. This
observation is recapitulated \emph{in vitro}, where DDLPS cell lines with
high MDM2 amplification have higher cell viability than MDM2 low
cells. We collaborated with Dr. Jim Chen to generate metabolomic and
lipidomic data in patient-derived DDLPS cell lines which was given to
me for analysis. The goal of this project was to identify
metabolomic/lipidomic differences in cell lines based on MDM2
amplification levels that could explain the chemoresistance of MDM2
high cell lines. Spanning the metabolomic and lipidomic data sets, I
identified several pairs of glycosylated/nonglycosylated forms of
ceramides which were significantly more highly glycosylated in MDM2
high cells than MDM2 low. This finding led to \emph{in vitro} experiments
that demonstrated that MDM2 high cells are susceptible to treatment
with ceramides. We also confirmed that the UGCG enzyme, which
catalyzes the glycosylation of ceramides, is more highly expressed in
MDM2 high cells than in low via Western blot. Upregulation of
glycosylated ceramides has been linked to increased chemoresistance in
a number of cancers. The manuscript for this project is in preparation
and will result in a co-first author publication for me. In preparing
this manuscript, I became aware of the many difficulties associated
with lipidomic data analysis, including challenges of incorporating
unidentified lipids or lipids without pathway annotations
into analysis. This motivated me to investigate approaches for
incorporating prior knowledge into lipidomic data analysis, while
still maintaining the capacity for data driven discovery, to utilize
lipids without prior knowledge associated with them.

\textbf{RaMP: A Comprehensive Relational Database of Metabolomics Pathways for
Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Genes and Metabolites:} Our group has
created RaMP, a MySQL database combining pathway information for
metabolites/proteins/genes from 4 major metabolomic pathway databases:
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome,
WikiPathways, and the Human Metabolome DataBase (HMDB). RaMP was
created to harmonize naming identification schemes and increase the
accessibility of chemical and biological annotations stored in these
major databases, in order to improve coverage of experimental data. I
helped develop the RaMP R package, which allows users to query the
database, perform pathway analysis, and cluster pathway analysis
results. The R package is also useful for integrating with other
R-based metabolomic data analysis tools. I also helped build the
associated RShiny app, a web-based tool that makes the functionality
of the RaMP package accessible to users with no programming
knowledge. The RaMP database will serve as a source of pathway,
biofluid ontology, disease ontology, and reaction knowledge for the
informative priors in my proposal, and we have plans to expand the
knowledge in the database to include chemical structure information as
well in the form of InChIKeys. My work on RaMP has resulted in a
textbook chapter and a second author publication.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Planned Dissertation:} My projects up to this point made me aware of
the challenges of interpreting lipidomic data, as well as the
importance of organizing and improving the availability of annotations
that are available for lipidomic data. High-throughput 'omic data is
expensive and difficult to obtain and interpret. Many analyses do not
make efficient use of this data, either by ignoring complex biological
interdependencies that explain experimental data, or by ignoring
analytes which have no prior knowledge associated with them. To
address these issues, the main goal for my doctoral dissertation is to
improve interpretability of lipidomic data. I plan to achieve this by
consolidating available lipid annotations from multiple sources into a
common database. This database will be used as a resource for improved
functional interpretation of lipidomic experiments. The focuses of my
research will be to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consolidate annotations from SwissLipids, LION/Web, LipidMaps,
and LipidPedia, including pathway, reaction, structural,
biochemical, tissue/subcellular location, and disease
annotations, into a common database that will serve as a
knowledge source for lipidomic analysis.
\item Improve interpretation of lipidomic data by developing
methodology for structural cluster analysis and pathway
coverage visualization.
\item Develop methodology for incorporating a variety of biological and
chemical annotations into a consensus similarity network model of
lipids identified in experimental data.
\item Apply a novel module search/random walk algorithm to similarity
model to identify modules of lipids that are perturbed with
regards to phenotype. Perform ORA to identify biological
processes associated with dysregulated lipid modules.
\item Compare my proposed methodology to a existing
ORA methodology, such as the Fisher's Exact test, or Metabolite
Set enrichment analysis, in real and simulated data, to
demonstrate increased capacity for detecting pathways altered
in tandem with phenotype.
\item Develop software that makes the approach accessible to
researchers.
\end{enumerate}
As mass-spectrometry or NMR generated data become more abundant, more
sophisticated analytical techniques will become necessary to make
sense of the underlying biology. My research and training in
lipidomics work as well as my participation in the development of
RaMP, which will serve as a rich source of biological knowledge for my
project, have ideally situated me to complete this project.

\section*{B) Training Goals and Objectives}
\label{sec:orgec45317}
I intend to use my remaining time in my graduate training to develop
the skills necessary to become an independent computational
metabolomics researcher. For this reason, my training goals are
designed to help me develop the general programming and chemistry
skills I feel are necessary to lead my own research group. My training
goals include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{General Computational Training:} Learning how to create and
maintain a comprehensive relational database of lipid pathways
using APIs of other publicly available lipid pathway databases,
developing my python and mySQL coding abilities through the
renovation of the RaMP database to improve my general knowledge
of techniques and software relevant to bioinformatics.
\item \textbf{Biological Networks:} Study how graph theory is applied in biological contexts to
ensure the biological validity of my proposed similarity network
fusion approach for analyzing lipidomic data
\item \textbf{Independently publishing open-source/reproducible software:}
Develop my R programming abilities to allow me to independently
develop an R package and interactive web application to make the
proposed database and methodologies more accessible to
researchers.
\item \textbf{General chemistry knowledge:} Improve my ability to
interpret metabolomics results, staying up to date with newest
and best practices for annotating lipid species.
\end{enumerate}

The first goal of my activity during this fellowship will be to
develop an integrative lipid annotations database as an extension to
the RaMP database developed by our group. The database will include an
associated R package for ORA of lipid pathways, as well as a
user-friendly interface. The proposed ORA method will deal with
differences in structural resolution between experimental data and
pathway annotations stored in databases, and will be tested to show
increased sensitivity towards altered lipid pathways over conventional
methods for ORA (e.g. Fisher's exact test). The results will be
summarized in a manuscript to be submitted in high-impact
metabolomic/bioinformatics journals such as \emph{Metabolites} or
\emph{Bioinformatics}. Beyond consulting with Dr. Mathe (mentor, see LOS) and
my lab members, I will work with the bioinformatics core here at Ohio
State as well as the bioinformatics training services provided by the
Ohio Supercomputing Cluster in order to develop the skills necessary
for database development and maintenance. The bioinformatics
department also hosts the semi-weekly computational systems biology
group, where computational biologists present their research in
progress, which I will also attend. OSU also offers a graduate level
Introduction to Database Systems course, which I intend to
take. Further, I will also attend more computationally oriented
workshops such as the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshop series, or the
Translational Data Analytics Institute at Ohio State, as well as more
computationally oriented conferences, such as the International
Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology series (BICOB
or GLBIO). I will also devote time to independent study of python and
mySQL using online resources such as Codecademy and DataCamp. 

The second goal of my activity during this fellowship will be to
develop and evaluate the proposed similarity network fusion
methodology in a variety of real and simulated data sets. I will be
focusing on demonstrating the method's capacity to detect biologically
relevant modules of lipids associated with disease that are not
detected by conventional methodology. If successful, this framework
could be extended beyond the lipidomics context, and be applied to
many different types of omics data (metabolomics, proteomics,
transcriptomics, microbiome, etc.), provided that there is prior
information available that could be integrated into a consensus
similarity network. Successful completion of this aim will require
that I improve my understanding of graph theory and how networks are
employed in a biological context. Dr. Lang Li has also been included
as a member of my graduate committee for this purpose, as he actively
conducts research using biological networks in the context of
transcriptomic or drug interaction networks. I am also interested in
taking Daphne Koller's probabilistic graph models course offered
through Coursera. Attending the computational conferences listed above
will provide me with more exposure to how networks are applied in a
biological context. Lastly, I am interested in attending a workshop on
biological network analysis, such as the International Workshop on
Computational Network Biology, or the International Workshop on
Biological Network Analysis and Integrative Graph-Based Approaches.

The third goal of my training is to develop my ability to
independently publish open-source, reproducible software. I aim to
develop all software associated with this proposal in line with the
FAIR guidelines (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible)
[REF]. These guidelines are designed to improve the transparency and
reproducibility of computational analyses and the example data
associated with them. Following these guidelines will help me develop
habits necessary for providing high-impact software for the research
community. Dr. Mathe's group is an ideal setting for me to learn
open-source software development, as we have already constructed the
RaMP multiomic pathway database and associated R package/shiny app,
which I contributed to. To further my training I plan on attending
future meetings of the BioConductor conference series, where leading
bioinformaticians provide workshops for best practices in R package
development as well as sharing their work in open source
bioinformatics software development. This added training will aid me
in developing associated R packages for any computational work that
results from the fellowship.

Lastly, I recognize the importance of continuing the development of my
biochemistry knowledge to better be able to leverage and interpret
mass spectrometric data. I will continue to attend yearly meetings of
the American Society of Mass Spectrometry, where they discuss a wide
variety of metabolomic/mass spectrometry topics important to
conducting independent research, including novel mass spectrometry
platforms, quantification techniques, spectral libraries,
bioinformatic pipelines, etc. Other conferences I am interested in
attending include the Metabolomics Association of North America, and
the International Conference of the Metabolomics Society. Further, I
have selected Dr. Rachel Kopec for my graduate committee, who is an
experienced metabolomics researcher in the context of human nutrition
and pharmaceutics, as well as one of the co-teachers of the
Metabolomics course taught at OSU, which I audited. OSU also offers
graduate level Biochemistry courses such as Advanced Biochemistry:
Membranes and Lipids, which I could take.

Following my graduate training, I intend to obtain a post-doctoral
position in a lab that will help me continue my training towards my
ultimate goal of becoming a computational metabolomics researcher. To
this end, I plan on applying to the groups of the leading developers
of software for metabolomic data processing and analysis, from
differential expression statistics to higher-level biological
interpretation, such as pathway analysis or multi-omic integration.
Example groups would include the lab of Dr. Tim Garrett at University
of Florida (LipidMatch, see LOS), Dr. Oliver Fiehn at UC Davis(MetaBox,
ChemRich), Dr. David Wishart at the University of Alberta (MSEA,
MetaboAnalyst), or Dr. Gary Siuzdak at the Scripps Research Institute
(XCMS). In the long term, I hope to lead my own group in computational
metabolomics research, following the example of the many talented and
passionate computational biologists I worked with at the NIH as well
as here at OSU.

During the course of the award I will be able to benefit immensely
from the support of my interdisciplinary mentorship team. My primary
mentor, Dr. Mathe, is an experienced metabolomics expert and
bioinformatician who has and will continue to mentor me in all aspects
of metabolomics research, from experimental design and data generation
to analysis and interpretation. She has also contributed to multiple R
packages/Shiny apps and MySQL databases, and has helped me learn other
skills necessary for collaborative software development, such as
proper use of version control software. My co-sponsor Dr. Coombes (see
LOS) is an accomplished statistician as well as an advocate for
reproducible research. His input on my project as well as his courses
(Rigor and Reproducibility \& Machine Learning) will be strong assets
for my research in guiding my research questions and leading to
scientifically robust and valid results. I currently meet with
Dr. Coombes and Dr. Mathe in person on a weekly basis, and will
continue to do so in the future.  My other committee members Dr. Kopec
and Dr. Li were also chosen due to their relevant areas of expertise
to my proposal. Dr. Kopec has collaborated with our group and served
as a resource to improve my biological understanding of metabolomics
data, meeting with me as necessary to guide my research
questions. Dr. Li's group has hosted me at their lab meetings to
critique some of my thesis ideas. His input on proper applications and
techniques when using biological network analysis have been invaluable
so far in the ideation process of my research plan, and he has agreed
to meet with me on a monthly basis in the future to continue to guide
my research progress. I plan to hold committee meetings every six
months until my eventual graduation.

Overall, my committee, conferences, research questions, and coursework
have been designed to give me the general programming and biochemistry
knowledge needed to become an independent researcher. Securing a
fellowship would be an enormous asset towards affording me the free
time and travel funds to achieve these goals and improve my current
and future impact on the research of lipids and their
interactions with human health.

 from OSU and elsewhere. OSU also offers career counseling and support
 services (CCSS) for graduate students, which leverages a large alumni
 network in a variety of career paths to help trainees explore career
 options and receive advice on training goals. CCSS also schedules
 regular mixers for graduate students with potential employers in
 academia and industry, to aid in networking. Additionally I plan to get involved
 with early-career societies for metabolomics researchers, such as the
