- Moved in this weekend. The new place is absolutely
  phenomenal. Washer/dryer and washing machine, quick commute to work,
  more space, this place has everything! After living in dingy
  apartments for the last 3.5 years it's hard to accept living in such
  a nice place. Gotta remind myself I'm still only paying around
  $600/month (equal to any place I lived in solo) in rent for my
  share. Gonna keep a close eye on my bank account but I think we've
  found our Columbus forever home. Hopefully the rent doesn't go up
  too much next year, but I'll worry about that then. For now feeling
  very lucky.
