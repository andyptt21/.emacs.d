- Testing out org-journal. It does not automatically load org mode,
  nor does it have a time listed (although as this is my only entry of
  the day, this might be expected.)
- It doesn't automatically save as an org file either... interesting.
- Scratch that last theory, it doesn't add a time for new entries

** 11:30 
- Okay, so to get a timestamp, just use C-c C-j every time. Nice!
- Looks like it has some awesome integration with org-agenda, if I
  ever decide to use that.
- So, since I waste a lot of time during the day, the purpose of this
  journal is to improve mindfulness and encourage writing when I can't
  be productive.
- Like previous attempts it may be short lived, but maybe the power
  and ease of emacs will make it a little more palatable.
- So, my main objective today is to perform LASSO regression on the
  proteogenomics data set to serve as reference for more conventional
  analytical techniques.
- LASSO regression is just a linear regression that penalizes for the
  number of independent variables included in the model I believe.
- Thus, you can throw a ton of data into a LASSO regression, and it
  will detect the independent variables that contribute the most to
  the dependent variable, and only include those in the final
  regression model.
- Do I have to specify lambda or will it automatically choose the best one?
