Multilayer Networks by Mason Porter

* Review Articles
** Review: Multilayer networks, Journal of Complex Networks. Kivela, Barthelemy, Gleeson, Moreno 
** Multilayer Networks in a Nutshell (2018)

* Multilayer network basics
** Multiple dimensions
*** e.g. Different time points, Different relationships
*** Intralayer vs interlayer relationships
*** Node-colored vs edge-colored network
** M = Multilayer network
** V = set of nodes
** L = sequence of sets of possible layers
** E = sets of edges (?)
** Represented by an /adjacency tensor/  :: This in turn can be turned into a "flattened" multilayer network, or a supra-adjacency representation

* Multimodal transportation networks
** Gallotti & Barthelemy /"Anatomy and Efficiency of Urban Multidimensional Mobility"/
** Used to compare probability of respecting time-tables based on distance travelled and transportation mode

* Community Structure
** Communities are Cohesive groups/modules
*** Trying to derive macroscale information from microscale data
** Rigid vs fuzzy clustering
** One approach is to optimize a quality function like a modularity function
** Community detection tends to be NP-hard
** Example algorithms include spectral and Louvain

* Roll-Call Voting Networks in Congress
** Intra-Layer connections are the number of times two senators voted the same way on a bill
** Inter-layer connections are different bills
** Data stretches from 1800-today
** Able to detect communities in this data

* R package: MuxVix
