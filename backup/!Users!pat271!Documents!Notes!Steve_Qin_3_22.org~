* Introduction
**** Tens or even hundreds of SNPs are often found to be associated with diseases in typical GWAS studies
**** Majority (~90%) of these SNPs are noncoding
**** Annotation of these noncoding variants is a major area of research
***** SIFT
***** PolyPhen
**** New methodology is needed to improve annotations
* Annotation
**** Information sources:
***** Phylogenetic conservation
****** PhastCon scores
****** GERP scores
***** Genomic profile
****** Overlap with known TF binding motif?
***** Epigenomic profile
**** Existing studies:
***** CADD
***** GWAVA
***** GenoCanyon
***** PAFA
***** PINES
***** Eigen/EigenPC
**** Can variants be annotated in a disease-specific manner?
**** DIVAN is Dr. Qin's method that inputs genomic and epigenomic data as features to distinguish risk variants from benign variants in a disease specific manner
**** Training set: GWAS SNP collection from NCBI
**** Also GRASP: Genome-Wide Repository of Associations between SNPs and Phenotype
**** Epigenome features collected mostly from ENCODE
**** Steps:
     1. Collect GWAS findings using summary statistic
     2. Apply ML to learn epigenomic and biological network features
        ("ensemble learning trees")
     3. Apply model to test cases
**** Challenges
***** Correlated multiomic data
***** /p/ >> /n/
***** Diverse data types
**** Solutions:
***** Feature selection (this is useful. He looks for features that are different between groups to build these models)
***** *How is the threshold for cross-validation determined?*
**** FeSel + Ensemble method
**** This could make a good reference for the benefits of feature selection
**** He gets a lot of benefit out of making his tool disease-specific (this must be an aspect of selcting training features)
**** They found that histone marks were more informative than chromatin status (open/closed) in predicting variant effects, which runs contrary to prior results
* Conclusions
**** Disease specific risk variant identidication is feasible
**** Need advanced statistical learning techniques
**** Advantages using reads instead of peaks
**** Histone marks are the most informative class of features
