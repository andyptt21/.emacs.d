*** Resource Sharing plan
1. The software should be freely available to biomedical researchers and educators in the
   nonprofit sector, such as institutions of education, research institutions, and government
   laboratories.
The software developed will be freely available for access and download on our server for use by
researchers and educators in the non-profit sector and for-profit sectors.

2. The terms of software availability should permit the dissemination and commercialization of
   enhanced or customized versions of the software, or incorporation of the software or pieces of it
   into other software packages.

Software will be shared via online dissemination venues including 1) depositing all source code in
GitHub (http://github.com), which will be accessible to all web users, 2) hosting R Shiny web
applications in OSU. With the software code hosted on GitHub and under the Apache 2 license, the
entire research community can readily contribute to its development, or use the code for their own
research.

3. To preserve utility to the community, the software should be transferable such that another
   individual or team can continue development in the event that the original investigators are
   unwilling or unable to do so.

We use R and R Shiny to develop the software, both of which are widely used in the research
community.  We also adhere to many best practices for project structure and coding conventions. A
new development team should have little technical difficulty adopting the project source, and
continuing the development.

4. The terms of software availability should include the ability of researchers to modify the source
   code and to share modifications with other colleagues. An applicant should take responsibility
   for creating the original and subsequent official versions of a piece of software.

The Apache 2 License and availability of the source code will allow researchers to further
develop/modify the software as they wish, and redistribute them to the community.  â€¢ Given the
modular nature of the analyses (e.g. functions and packages address specific types of analyses), the
functions and packages can readily be plugged into other software, as will be the case with the
Galaxy-P software (see LOS).

5. To further enhance the potential impact of their software, applicants may consider proposing a
   plan to manage and disseminate the improvements or customizations of their tools and resources by
   others. This application for funding may include a plan to incorporate the enhancements into the
   official core software, may involve the creation of an infrastructure for plug-ins, or may
   describe some other solution

Best practices in open software development will be applied to ensure that users can access the
latest versions of the software and continue with their development as they see fit.  These best
practices include 1) extensive documentation, tutorials, and technical reports in Wiki/Web pages, 2)
ability to obtain and address feedback through mailing lists and Wiki comments, and 3) source code
and version control (embedded in Github).
