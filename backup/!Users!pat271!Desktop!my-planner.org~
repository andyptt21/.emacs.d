#+TITLE: Planner for organizing tasks and keeping accessible notes
#+AUTHOR: Andy Patt

* To do (URGENT):
** TODO :F31: Finalize training plan
- P.2: Consider writing a few sentences on you passing your
  candidacy and who your committee members are, that part looks
  like a copy/paste from your CV.
- P.3.: “I plan to achieve this by developing a database…”.  This
  sentence is hard to understand I think.  Reviewers won’t know
  what you mean by addressing differences in structural
  resolution between databases.  Also, is doing an ORA that you
  propose in this sentence still part of the plan?
- P.3.: Focus #2: the novelty is not necessarily in the random
  walk algorithm, but in how you’re building the network that
  aggregates multiple types of information.
- P.3: Focus #3: I that really a focus?  ORA is not novel at all.
- I think your training goals/objectives are clear, Your aim
  about developing programming skills though is a little week.
  You should push this further, maybe going the route of adopting
  best practices (FAIR) of open source community…
- P.4.: Consider publishing in Metabolites, not Metabolomics,
  since Metabolites is now the official journal of the
  Metabolomics Society.  Also consider changing BMC
  Bioinformatics to Bioinformatics (BMC is not high impact).
- P.4.: If you propose to work with the core here, then you
  should get an LOS from them. You can talk to Maciej.
- P.4.: You mention the machine learning course but Kevin and I
  are not co-teaching it.  You also do not mention any courses
  about statistical knowledge (It'll be taught by Qin Ma in the future)
- Regarding your graph theory part, Lang doesn’t use only Bayesian
  networks.  Talk to him and see what other resources you could learn.
  Also talk to Tara and see if she has any suggestions, she knows the
  CSE courses quite well.
- When you refer to people for which you have an LOS, make a note
  of that. Eg.g. Dr. Ewy Mathe (mentor, see LOS).
- P.5: You’ve listed the top people in the field for your
  post-doc, I would consider adding potentially others…how about
  Tim Garrett in Florida?
- P.5: I would rephrase Dr. Li’s involvement in your candidacy
  here and be more specific.
- What is the difference between your committee members for your
  thesis and your mentors for the grant?
- Your last statement could include something about how you want
  to have an impact in the field of xxx.
- Include a paragraph about what the relationship with the
  mentors is going to be like (meeting frequency)
- Mention computational systems biology group

** TODO :F31: Draft LOSs

*** Translatability from model to human
*** Meta-analysis method for combining results from different cohorts to demonstrate reproducibility
*** Central biological question
**** Model to human (show you get similar results with the same method in vitro and in vivo)
**** Pan cancer (you can translate results from one disease to another)
**** Metanalysis (combine results from independent cohorts)
*** Can you combine independent analyses in different omes or do you have to integrate while analysing?
*** Pathways:
**** Biochemical pathways
**** Molecular pathways
**** KEGG is the only database that draws this distinction. Is this significant?
**** TOPPGene returns different types of annotations. How is this done? Where is their info derived from?

** TODO :LIFE: eRequests for other expenses
** TODO :LIFE: CITI Training
** TODO :LIPOSARCOMA: Find 1:1 mappings between metabolon and lipidomic set and show they have same directionality
** TODO :F31: Research Plan
*** TODO Add negative control metabolites to the experiment (metabolites you DON'T think are altered)
*** TODO Try to find experimentally validated metabolites in the data that you can work with
*** TODO You need to have a list of metabolites that are altered (reflected in the different methods)
*** TODO Show that in one pathway, the relationships you find that are highly proximal in the network are also close in the reaction network
*** It could be interesting if you get different answers with the Bayesian network analysis
*** See what happens when you only perturb one node between two data sets in terms of network structure
*** How do we tie this into finding differential relationships? That's the real value of this project
*** Try to figure out how to make this a pathway analysis strategy
*** Try to find labeling experiment metabolite dataset
*** BNlearn
   - Try to get everything in that figure on a p-value scale
*** Other
   - Biological validation
   - The goal is to go beyond the level of individual metabolites
   - Maybe sell as a potential criterion for identifying unidentified
     metabolites (probably the m:g stuff)
   - The big impact will be focusing on changes in relationships
     instead of changes in individual features
   - Will this be a class prediction or class comparison approach?
   - Maybe try an experimental setup showing the differences between a
     model that incorporates an unidentified metabolite vs an
     identified metabolite
   - You really need to clearly identify the "killer" application
     + Needs to be more interesting than class prediction or class
       comparison
     + Really go after the interpretability angle. Maybe this helps
       you figure out the role of unidentified metabolites?
     + Really think about going the microbiome route. There's usable
       ground truth available
     + NSJ16 database
   - Read reviews of more recent metabolomics analyses (Siudzak,
       Fahy, Wishart, Fiehn, Egon Willighagen, Stephen Newman, etc.)
   - Should be applied to a lot of datasets to demonstrate that the
     method can be leveraged by a variety of biological contexts
   - Maybe this can be used to suggest the function of noncoding genes
     as well
   - People want to know how microbiome context interacts with the
     metabolome
   - See if you can recover reaction relationships with priors that
     don't use reactions. This could be a form of biological validation.
   - Correlate between your prior networks and purely data-driven approaches

    accomplish these goals
  - Try to find more informatics conferences to attend in the future
  - Career development resources for getting a postdoc
  - Are there other methods the priors could be applied to?
  - Mention your specific data set in the specific aims

** Proteogenomics 
*** Notes on reviewer feedback:
**** Talk about different utilities
**** Need to directly compare to the winners
   - Could be difficult since the validation data set was never published
   - Need to get the details of their methodology
**** Why did we pick those three methods?
**** Due May 18th
**** All analyses must be done by end of April
**** Hongyang call:
     1. Submit questions to Yan:
	1. How did they filter/select features?
	   - Use all available genes as features
	   - However, only keep genes with no missing values
	2. How did they combine their models?
	   - Weighted averages based on performance in training set
	3. How did they cross-validate?
	   - 50/50 training test set
	   - 5x cross-validation
	4. What info did they use? (genes, pathways, protein structure, etc.)
	   - Final submission did not use external info. They
             experimented with filtering by pathway but it didn't
             improve performance
	   - They also did not use gene copy number info 
     2. LASSO Regression for prediction
     3. Tuning parameters for Bayesian networks and LASSO
     4. Compare to Guan's results

* To do (long term):
** TODO :LIPOSARCOMA: Liposarcoma todo
*** UGCG notes:
**** UGCG tends to be downregulated in response to DNA damage
**** High MDM2 -> low p53 -> increased DNA damage -> *low UGCG expression* -> increased Ceramide pool (?) -> more apoptosis
**** So canonically, an inverse correlation between MDM2 and UGCG makes sense
**** Treatment of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with glucosylceramides actually increased tumor growth!
**** How is enzyme regulated?
*** Look up post-translational modifications of UGCG, look up mechanism of action
*** Research connection between UGCG and p53
*** Make git repo
** TODO Get watch fixed
** TODO Check on passport status
** TODO Look at Tim and Jeremy's data
