** TODO :LIPOSARCOMA: Ceramide pathway figure for Liposarcoma
* Projects
** Liposarcoma
    - First paper will be submitted to Analytical Chemistry,
     differences in MDM2 dependence
   - Ceramide paper will be chemoresistance in liposarcoma cell lines
     based on ceramide glycosylation mode
   - Jim found a significant effect of UGCG on survival in the SARC cohort
   - ASAH1 (reverse enzyme) had no significant result
   - Try to recreate these results with a cox regression or use a
     median/mean cutoff
   - Demonstrate concordance of shift of lipids by MDM2 status between
     databases
** F31 Application
*** Review references on Bayesian Networks applied to multiomic data
*** Background:
**** What's been done?
**** What hasn't been done?
**** What will your contribution be?
*** Research plan notes:
  - You need to make the connect between what you want to accomplish
    and how you want to do it
  - See if you can find classes or faculty that can help you
    accomplish these goals
  - Try to find more informatics conferences to attend in the future
  - Career development resources for getting a postdoc
  - Are there other methods the priors could be applied to?
  - Mention your specific data set in the specific aims
  - Be more explicit about how you're going to validate in the
    specific aims (e.g. compare to other methods)
  - Be more explicit about the contribution your research is making
  - Use underlining for your hypothesis and other important sentences
  - Make sure you justify the need for software development in aim 3
  - Need explicit statements of the significance of the approach
    (bullet points are good for this)
  - Developing the priors is the chief innovation

** Proteogenomics 
*** TODO See if there's any parameters you need to optimize a little better
*** Notes on reviewer feedback:
**** Talk about different utilities
**** Need to directly compare to the winners
   - Could be difficult since the validation data set was never published
   - Need to get the details of their methodology
**** Why did we pick those three methods?
**** Due May 18th
**** All analyses must be done by end of April
**** Hongyang call:
     1. Submit questions to Yan:
	1. How did they filter/select features?
	   - Use all available genes as features
	   - However, only keep genes with no missing values
	2. How did they combine their models?
	   - Weighted averages based on performance in training set
	3. How did they cross-validate?
	   - 50/50 training test set
	   - 5x cross-validation
	4. What info did they use? (genes, pathways, protein structure, etc.)
	   - Final submission did not use external info. They
             experimented with filtering by pathway but it didn't
             improve performance
	   - They also did not use gene copy number info 
     2. LASSO Regression for prediction
     3. Tuning parameters for Bayesian networks and LASSO
     4. Compare to Guan's results

* Planned Publications:
1) MDM2-dependent liposarcoma differences
2) DREAM Challenge review
3) Ceramides contribute to chemoresistance in liposarcoma
4) Bayesian Networks with Informative Priors to identify deregulated metabolites
5) Bayesian Networks with Informative Priors to integrate
   metabolite/transcript data
6) LipidMatch flow
* To do (long term):
** TODO :LIPOSARCOMA: Liposarcoma todo
*** UGCG notes:
**** UGCG tends to be downregulated in response to DNA damage
**** High MDM2 -> low p53 -> increased DNA damage -> *low UGCG expression* -> increased Ceramide pool (?) -> more apoptosis
**** So canonically, an inverse correlation between MDM2 and UGCG makes sense
**** Treatment of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with glucosylceramides actually increased tumor growth!
**** How is enzyme regulated?
*** Look up post-translational modifications of UGCG, look up mechanism of action
*** Research connection between UGCG and p53
*** Make git repo
** TODO Get watch fixed
** TODO Check on passport status
** TODO Look at Tim and Jeremy's data

** TODO Fix RaMP pathway clustering
** TODO Associate eRA account w/ NLM
** TODO Get new tires
** TODO Set up Roth IRA
