#+TITLE: Fantasy Week 18

Times are tense as we grow closer to the trade deadline. In the wild wild West just 8 points separate last place from WC2. Anyone could make the playoffs. Literally anyone.

Dylan Strome is on a 77 point pace in Chicago. Maybe Nick Schmaltz will play more than half the season next year for Arizona. The desert continues to be where hockey talent goes to die.

** Power Rankings 
#+CAPTION: Will is now top of the standings. He couldn't possibly win the championship 4 times in 6 years, could he?

1. *Will* - Will posted a great week, with excellent blocks, shots, ATOI and goaltending. He's now in sole possession of the number one spot in the league standings and is closing in on number one in the seasonal power rankings. I believe he's also clinched a playoff spot.

2. [@2] *Lucas* - Goaltending is still his calling card (autodraft treated him well), but superlative scoring earns him the #2 spot this week. Jonathan Toews is having a great year, and Hertl was a shrewd pickup. I think if he loses out and Zack wins out and Tim gets another point, he'll miss the playoffs though. Sad!
3. *Ethan* - He's baaaack. If he claims the Atlantic division title from Jacob he could make the playoffs, but that could be a tall order given his numbers this season (see Figure 3, wayyy up at the top).
4. *Zack* - Zack has been legitimately solid recently and boasts some strong talent with Ovi, Stamkos and Burns. He'll probably have to catch Kyle to make the playoffs though.
5. *Andy* - Mediocre week for me, skaters have gone anemic. Hopefully the return of Big Buff from injury shakes things up. Funnily enough, I still clinched the Western Division and a playoff spot this week. Could this be the year this team breaks through in the finals (0-2)?
6. *Oliver* - Solid comeback from last week but goalies are still a major problem.
7. *Ted* - Good scoring numbers but forgettable everywhere else
8. *Kyle* - A rough stretch for Kyle who's built a comfortable cushion in the playoff race but is in need of a shakeup to make some noise. Scoring is the issue here.
9. *Jacob* - Jacob's furious mid season rally has slowed. He'll need to hold off Ethan but the playoffs are still very much a possibility.
10. *Tim* - A stinker for Tim who's big guns have suddenly gone cold. Malkin is coming back from injury, which is nice. See Lucas' blurb for clinching scenarios, but replace Lucas with Tim and Tim with Lucas.
11. *Chris* - At least he's not last in the power rankings
12. *Donald* - See Chris

4 weeks left to go in the fantasy season, less than two until the trade deadline!
