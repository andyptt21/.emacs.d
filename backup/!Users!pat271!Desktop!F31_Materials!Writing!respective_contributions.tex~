\section*{Respective Contributions}
\label{sec:org0d9063f}
\textbf{\uline{Andrew Patt, B.Sc.:}} I developed the ideas for this proposal with the help of Dr. Mathe and
Dr. Coombes, in weekly meetings and via emails with Dr. Mathe, as well as regular meetings with
Dr. Coombes and members of his group. I was responsible for cleaning the data used in the proposal,
including filtration for missing values and variance, and identifying biological pathways of
interest that could be used to generate a figure. I also wrote all code used to generate the figures
in the proposal.The data used in the proposal comes from THESE PUBLICATIONS (). I am the primary
author of this proposal but I received editorial feedback from each member of my thesis committee:
Dr. Mathe, Dr. Coombes, Dr. Li and Dr. Kopec. I will perform the required analyses of the proposal
as well as be the primary developer of the associated R package and RShiny app.

\textbf{\uline{Ewy Mathe, PhD:}} Dr. Mathe will be the primary mentor for the proposed project. She will provide
her R programming expertise to instruct me in best practices for software development, and help me
troubleshoot difficulties with software. She will also be a resource for help with supercomputing as
well as publicly hosting the Shiny app that results from the project. Through monthly presentations
to our group I will receive regular feedback on my progress from my peers. I will also have
one-on-one meetings with Ewy personally to discuss ideas and issues, and receive more directed
feedback. Ewy has also provided me a desk space with an additional computer monitor to work
with. Ewy is partially funded by the Translational Data Analytics at OSU initiative, and has
received numerous NIH grants for data analytics and metabolomics.

\textbf{\uline{Kevin Combes, PhD:}} Dr. Coombes has a long history of successful mentorship of Graduate students
and will provide me with feedback and guidance during his weekly lab meetings. Dr. Coombes'
expertise in Machine Learning and Bayesian statistics will be invaluable in ensuring the scientific
validity of my methodology. Dr. Coombes' office is very close to mine for immediate feedback, and
the postdoctoral members of his group will also continue to meet with me frequently for further
research advisement as well as serving as resources for career development advice. Dr. Coombes also
has also received extensive funding from OSU as well as the NIH.
