* Background
Lipidmatch Flow is an extension of the LipidMatch lipid identification
software that aims to be an end-to-end pipeline for LC-MS/MS lipidomic
data analysis. In its current implementation, it allows users to input
raw MS/MS data files from common vendors (Agilent, Thermo, and SCIEX)
into a graphical interface that automatically performs file conversion
using MSConvert, peak picking (optimized by vendor) using MZmine, and
then identification with Lipidmatch. It is available [[http://secim.ufl.edu/secim-tools/lipidmatchflow/][here]] in its beta
version. I was involved in a small portion of development of
Lipidmatch Flow, in which I worked with Jeremy to develop an algorithm
for merging identical IDs across ionization modes. The manuscript for
the software is currently in preparation and I will be included as 4th
or 5th author. We have discussed working with Jeremy and Dr. Garrett
on implementing modules for LipidMatch flow allowing for automatic
statistical analysis of data given user-defined groups, pathway
analysis, and multiomic integration.

* Rationale
In a [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187425][recent review]], Pauling and Klipp argue that the 3 frontiers of
lipidomic research are: 
1. Analysis of mass spectral libraries for identification and quantification
2. Statistical routines for quality control, start-to-end standardization, and
3. Functional analysis, data-mining, and multi-omic integration

LipidMatch flow offers a unique opportunity to make contributions to
points two and three as an end-to-end lipidomic analysis
pipeline. Specifically, point three will require innovation to
achieve, as lipid pathway annotations are scarce, and as such there is a
noticeable lack of pathway analysis tools geared towards
lipids. Functional analysis of lipid data is difficult for several
other reasons as well, such as the high diversity of lipid structures
compared to other metabolite classes or omic data types, and highly
inconsistent nomenclatures/classification systems that vary in their
structural resolution. Nonetheless, lipids are a highly bioactive
class of metabolites that affect diverse functions such as membrane
fluidity/permeability, signaling, energy storage, and thus are
worthwhile to study. Specifically in the context of human disease,
cancer cells are known to significantly upregulate /de novo/ synthesis
of fatty acids in what is known as the lipogenic
phenotypes. Ceramides, a class of sphingolipids which are known to
regulate apoptosis, are often dysregulated in tumor cells. The
mevalonate pathway, which synthesizes isoprenoid lipids such as
cholesterol and steroid hormones, [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29238070][has been suggested as a therapeutic
target in mutant p53 tumors.]]
