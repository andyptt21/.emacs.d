\section*{Selection of Mentor and Institution}
\label{sec:org9e90ad0}

I chose the Ohio State University (OSU) Biomedical Sciences Graduate
Program (BSGP) due to the excellent informatics resources available,
as well as the rich educational environment fostered by the Umbrella
Program setup, which allows me to interact with other early-career
scientists as well as faculty from a variety of research backgrounds
and interests. The BSGP curriculum is mainly centered around reading
and discussing papers, technical writing/communication, and ethics
education, providing students with a solid understanding of topical
subjects in biomedical research today. Participating in the BSGP has
also given me ample funding opportunities, as I was funded by the BMI
departmental T15 grant in my first year, and was chosen to be one of
the four in my cohort of 16 to receive two years of funding from a
BSGP departmental T32 training grant for my second and third
years. These opportunities allowed me to attend conferences such as
the NLM training conference in 2017, where I was able to network with
bioinformatics trainees from other institutions, as well as take the
special T32 seminar, which gave me a weekly journal club setting with
other fellows in which we could discuss papers and our research
progress in a small setting. I have also benefited from access to the
Ohio Super Computer resource, which allows me to perform the high
powered computations needed for high dimensional omics research. This
will be a valuable asset as I continue to experiment with the
intensive algorithms used to infer network structures in
high-dimensional data. Ohio State also offers a rich mass spectrometry
research community, with two active research facilities/shared
resources, as well as preeminent metabolomics/proteomics researchers,
including my PI Dr. Mathe and committee member Dr. Kopec (see
LOR). Lastly, I have immensely benefited from close proximity to the
Ohio State University Comprehensive Care Center (CCC), the home of
more than 300 cancer researchers and their research groups, which has
maintained its NCI-designated CCC status since 1976, and in its most
recent site visit (May 2015) received a perfect 10/10 score from the
NCI. The OSUCCC provides lectures, intramural conferences, and rich
collaboration opportunities, such as my work with Dr. Jim Chen (see
LOR), whose data will be used for biological validation of my
computational work. I am fortunate and proud to be routinely exposed
to so many talented researchers and trainees at Ohio State.

Entering the BSGP, I was looking for a mentor who was an accomplished
bioinformatician with a productive publication record who would take a
personal interest in my training, and who had a history of
successfully obtaining NIH funding.  Dr. Mathe leads a productive
metabolomics/integrative omics group, and has published articles in
high impact journals such as \emph{Cell} and \emph{Cancer Research}, and thus was a
perfect fit for my ambitions. Dr. Mathe's passion for training has
been evident during my time working with her, as I am able to interact
with her weekly in our lab meetings as well as our weekly individual
meetings and frequent impromptu meetings. Dr. Mathe has consistently
helped push me to find opportunities to communicate my work at
internal and external conferences. She has also helped me apply for
and obtain funding through the T32, by reviewing my writing and
helping me prepare the oral presentation required for the
fellowship. She also has helped me in organizing a biweekly
bioinformatics technical skills workshop, which is meant to
communicate essential bioinformatics skills to members of our group
and others in the department in an interactive workshop setting. This
has aided in my communication skills and helped round out my toolkit
as a bioinformatics researcher. These examples demonstrate the high
degree of interest and enthusiasm Dr. Mathe has displayed in ensuring
I develop my career as a researcher. She is also never hesitant to
offer me advice and constructive feedback on my research progress, as
well as answer any questions I have about goals and opportunities
following my graduation from the program.

My co-sponsor, Dr. Coombes, is an experienced mathematician and
bioinformatician, with an extensive history of NIH funding and
high-impact publications in the genomics and proteomics of breast
cancer and other cancers, including articles in \emph{Nature}, \emph{Cancer Cell},
and \emph{Genome Biology.} He has also achieved notoriety for his work as a
forensic bioinformatician, using aspects of raw data and reported
results to infer missing methodology from published works to ensure
that reported scientific results are valid, and not skewed by
analytical error. His work in this field has resulted in press
coverage on \emph{60 Minutes}, the \emph{New York Times}, and \emph{Nature News}. Outside
of his extensive resume of mentoring successful graduate students,
Dr. Coombes has taught or co-taught a large variety of courses in our
department, and instills his values in students by teaching how to
properly document computational methodology through well-written,
well-annotated code. As a co-mentor he has frequently weighed in on my
research questions to ensure that my experimental setups are
hypothesis-driven and able to be scientifically validated. He has also
introduced me to the post-doctoral trainees working in his group, who
have provided me with an extensive amount of training and career
guidance in the past as well. My co-mentors are an outstanding team of
accomplished bioinformaticians who will provide me with exceptional
support and guidance throughout the proposed research project.
