\section*{Selection of Mentor and Institution}
\label{sec:org7a70bee}

I chose the Ohio State University (OSU) Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (BSGP) due to the
excellent informatics resources available, as well as the rich educational environment fostered by
the Umbrella Program setup, which allows me to interact with other early-career scientists as well
as faculty from a variety of research backgrounds and interests. The BSGP curriculum is mainly
centered around reading and discussing papers, technical writing/communication, and ethics
education, providing students with a solid understanding of topical subjects in biomedical research
today. The program also offers eleven areas of research interest, including Computational Biology
and Bioinformatics, which requires several electives taught through the Biomedical Informatics
department as well as electives taken through the computer science and statistics departments. The
diverse courses required by the Bioinformatics curriculum have deepened my understanding of
Bioinformatics and Biomedical Research topics, and helped me refine my research questions as well as
develop my writing. Participating in the BSGP has also given me ample funding opportunities in the
past, as I was funded by the BMI departmental T15 grant in my first year, and was chosen to be one of the
four in my cohort of 16 to receive two years of funding from a BSGP departmental T32 training grant
for my second and third years. These funding opportunities allowed me to attend extra conferences
such as the NLM training conference in 2017, where I was able to network with bioinformatics
trainees from other institutions, as well as take the special T32 seminar, which gave me a weekly
journal club setting with other fellows in which we could discuss papers and our research progress
in a small setting. I have also benefited from access to the Ohio Super Computer
resource, which allows me to run memory-intensive scripts without tying up my laptop. This will
prove to be a valuable asset as I continue to experiment with the intensive algorithms used to infer
network structures in high-dimensional data. Ohio State also offers a rich mass spectrometry
research community, with two active cores that investigate a wide variety of topics relating to
food/crop science and human health, and preeminent metabolomics/proteomics researchers, including my
PI Dr. Mathe and committee member Dr. Kopec. Lastly, I have immensely benefited from close proximity
to the Ohio State University Comprehensive Care Center (CCC), the home of more than 300 cancer
researchers and their research groups, which has maintained its NCI-designated CCC status since
1976, and in its most recent site visit (May 2015) received a perfect 10/10 score from the NCI. The
OSUCCC provides lectures, intramural conferences, and rich collaboration opportunities, such as my
work with Dr. Jim Chen. I am fortunate and proud to be routinely exposed to so many talented
researchers and trainees at Ohio State.

Entering the BSGP, I was looking for a mentor who was an accomplished bioinformatician with a
productive publication record who would take a personal interest in my training, and who had a
history of successfully obtaining NIH funding. Dr. Mathe and her group at OSU met those
requirements, and since joining her group I have benefited immensely from Dr. Mathe's devoted
mentorship. Dr. Mathe's passion for training has been evident during my time working with her, as I
am able to interact with her weekly in our lab meetings as well as our one-on-one meetings, and
frequently via email and impromptu meetings. Dr. Mathe has consistently helped push me to find
opportunities to communicate my work at internal and external conferences. She has also helped me
apply for and obtain funding through the T32, by reviewing my writing and helping me prepare the
oral presentation required for the fellowship. She also has helped me in organizing a biweekly
bioinformatics technical skills workshop, which is meant to communicate essential bioinformatics
skills to members of our group and others in the department in an interactive workshop setting. This
has aided in my communication skills and helped round out my toolkit as a bioinformatics
researcher. These examples demonstrate the high degree of interest and enthusiasm Dr. Mathe has
displayed in ensuring I develop my career as a researcher. She is also never hesitant to offer me
advice and constructive feedback on my research progress, as well as answer any questions I have
about goals and opportunities following my graduation from the program.

My co-sponsor, Dr. Coombes, is an experienced mathematician and bioinformatician, with an extensive
history of NIH funding and high-impact publications in the genomics and proteomics of breast cancer
and other cancers, including articles in \emph{Nature}, \emph{Cancer Cell}, and \emph{Genome Biology.} He has also
achieved notoriety for his work as a forensic bioinformatician, using aspects of raw data and
reported results to infer missing methodology from published works to ensure that reported scientific
results are valid, and not skewed by analytical error. His work in this field has resulted in press
coverage on \emph{60 Minutes}, the \emph{New York Times}, and \emph{Nature News}. Outside of his extensive resume of
mentoring successful graduate students, Dr. Coombes has taught or co-taught a large variety of
courses in our department, and instills his values in students by teaching how to properly document
computational methodology through well-written, well-annotated code. As a co-mentor he has
frequently weighed in on my research questions to ensure that my experimental setups are
hypothesis-driven and able to be scientifically validated. He has also introduced me to the
post-doctoral trainees working in his group, who have provided me with an extensive amount of
training and career guidance in the past as well. My co-mentors are an outstanding team of
accomplished bioinformaticians who will provide me with exceptional support and guidance throughout
the proposed research project.
