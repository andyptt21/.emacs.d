\section*{Background}
\label{sec:org11817e0}

Lipidmatch Flow is an extension of the LipidMatch lipid identification
software that aims to be an end-to-end pipeline for LC-MS/MS lipidomic
data analysis. In its current implementation, it allows users to input
raw MS/MS data files from common vendors (Agilent, Thermo, and SCIEX)
into a graphical interface that automatically performs file conversion
using MSConvert, peak picking (optimized by vendor) using MZmine, and
then identification with Lipidmatch. It is available \href{http://secim.ufl.edu/secim-tools/lipidmatchflow/}{here} in its beta
version. I was involved in a small portion of development of
Lipidmatch Flow, in which I worked with Jeremy to develop an algorithm
for merging identical IDs across ionization modes. The manuscript for
the software is currently in preparation and I will be included as 4th
or 5th author. We have discussed working with Jeremy and Dr. Garrett
on implementing modules for LipidMatch flow allowing for automatic
statistical analysis of data given user-defined groups, pathway
analysis, and multiomic integration.

\section*{Rationale}
\label{sec:org4974daf}

Lipids are a highly bioactive class of metabolites that affect diverse
functions such as membrane fluidity/permeability, signaling, energy
storage, and thus are worthwhile to study. Specifically in the context
of human disease, cancer cells are known to significantly upregulate
\emph{de novo} synthesis of fatty acids in what is known as the lipogenic
phenotypes. Ceramides, a class of sphingolipids which are known to
regulate apoptosis, are often dysregulated in tumor cells. The
mevalonate pathway, which synthesizes isoprenoid lipids such as
cholesterol and steroid hormones, \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29238070}{has been suggested as a therapeutic
target in mutant p53 tumors.} However, significant challenges still
hinder the ability of researchers to examine the lipidome.

In a \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187425}{recent review}, Pauling and Klipp \cite{pmid28187425} argue that the 3 frontiers of
lipidomic research are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Analysis of mass spectral libraries for identification and quantification
\item Statistical routines for quality control, start-to-end standardization, and
\item Functional analysis, data-mining, and multi-omic integration
\end{enumerate}

LipidMatch flow offers a unique opportunity to make contributions to
points two and three as an end-to-end lipidomic analysis
pipeline. Specifically, point three will require innovation to
achieve, as lipid pathway annotations are scarce, and as such there is a
noticeable lack of pathway analysis tools geared towards
lipids. Ontology terms such as association with disease, subcellular
location, etc., for individual lipid species are difficult to
procure as well, making ontological analysis difficult. Functional analysis of lipid data is difficult for several
other reasons as well, such as the high diversity of lipid structures
compared to other metabolite classes or omic data types, and highly
inconsistent nomenclatures/classification systems that vary in their
structural resolution. One key advantage of working with LipidMatch
generated data will be access to a consistent nomenclature among
identified lipids. 

\section*{Approach}
\label{sec:orgcc708c3}

\subsection*{Statistics}
\label{sec:org41283dc}

For statistical analysis, we propose to create software for comparison
between two groups in parametric (T-test) or nonparametric (Welch's)
fashion, or multiple groups (ANOVA/Wilcoxon). FDR adjustment of
p-values will be performed and associated volcano plots will be
provided. Fisher's tests will be used to find overrepresented lipid
classes separated by directionality. These results will provide a concise,
high-level view of the class-based trends occurring in the data,
easing interpretation of results.

\subsection*{Pathway analysis: Overrepresentation analysis}
\label{sec:org8d19459}

\#\# Which database are we going to use?
\#\# How will the statistics accommodate duplicate identifications? This
\#\# could be a statistics question

One approach our group has already employed successfully in pathway
analysis of lipid data involves mapping of lipid species to generic
KEGG structures and performing overrepresentation analysis (ORA) using the
full lipid panel as background. Pathway annotations for general lipid
structures could also be procured from LipidMaps and
wikipathways. Overrepresentation could be assessed using a
Fisher's/Hypergeometric test, or a KS test (similar to MSEA) 

\subsection*{Reaction analysis: Find shifted ratios in known biological reactions}
\label{sec:org2c6dc75}
\#\# Are there any ontologies of reactions available? `
\#\# What do general classes of reactions accomplish?
\#\# Which reactions occur spontaneously vs. enzymatically?

\subsection*{Pathway analysis: Structural similarity clustering}
\label{sec:org81fd211}

A growing trend in metabolomics research is to perform structural
clustering of metabolomic results, with the underlying hypothesis that
biological function correlates to structure, which is especially true
in lipids. Chemical structural similarity can be assessed in a variety
of ways. Our group is working towards building a database of
InChi-keys (a high-resolution chemical structure textual identifier)
and experimenting with various methods of assessing structural
similarity using string metrics such as least-common substring or
Levenshtein distance. Structural cluster labels can then be used as
input for ORA. Structural clusters will allow for even higher-level
views of class-based trends, giving researchers another tool for
identifying similar lipids exhibiting similar statistical trends.

\subsection*{Multiomic integration: Bayesian Network integration with transcriptomic/metabolomic data}
\label{sec:orgaa9f71b}

Tools for multiomic integration of lipid data with other omic types
are extremely scarce. We propose a strategy for construction of
Bayesian network models with informative priors, a framework which
will allow for integration of a variety of prior knowledge sources
regarding lipid/transcript or lipid/metabolite relationships,
including pathway commonality, reaction level information, structural
similarity, biological class, and ontological terms, in order to infer
relationships in a prior knowledge/data driven fashion. Multiomic
integration is a powerful tool for hypothesis generation as well as
improving mechanistic insight.
