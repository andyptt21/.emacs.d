** TODO Install some packages
** TODO Sign up for XCMS

* Class 1 [2019-01-07 Mon]
** Objectives
*** Discuss each part of the metabolomics workflow
*** Relevant to cancer biology and crop science
*** First assignment is to send a primary research article to Jess by Wednesday and present briefly on it on 1/16
** Metabolomics
*** Closest to phenotype
*** Always exerting an effect, unlike genes or transcripts for example
*** Very different between organisms
*** Examples:
**** Amino acids
**** Lipids
**** Sugars
**** Vitamins
**** Phytochemicals
**** Toxins
*** Extremely diverse, especially in plants
**** This is an analytical challenge. We're not looking at a specific set of nucleic acids or amino acids 
*** Highly dynamic
*** No reference metabolome
*** Large differences due to instrumentation platforms
*** Untargeted Metabolomics involves 100s/1000s of metabolites
*** Targeted is more like ~20. Targeted Metabolomics is therefore a bit of an oxymoron
*** Untargeted MS-based metabolomics is always comparative, not quantitative
*** Untargeted and targeted are soft categorizations
*** Uses:
**** Chemical profiling
**** Identify bioitic/abiotic stressors
**** Detect phenotype dependent differences
**** Identify biomarkers
* Class 2 [2019-01-09 Wed]
** Metabolomics workflow
*** Scientific hypothesis
*** Choose samples
**** Need to address the question
**** Eliminate as many confounding variables as possible
**** Examples:
***** Plasma
***** Urine
***** Tissue
***** Biofluids
***** Cells
*** Prepare samples for analysis
**** You can only detect what you present to an instrument for analysis
**** Use a polar solvent when you want to extract polar metabolites and vice versa
**** You can also just dilute a sample to bias your metabolites less, but your samples will be extremely complex
**** If you're doing NMR you have the option to not do sample prep/use solid samples

*** Acquire raw data
**** Three most popular: GC-MS, LC-MS, NMR
**** Data will be retention time and m/z acquired from regular scans
*** Spectral processing
**** Raw spectral data needs to ultimately be turned into a giant table of IDs and abundances per sample
*** Post-acquisition data analysis
**** Significance testing, unsupervised/supervised clustering/machine learning
**** Metaboanalyst is a popular metabolomics interpretation tool
*** Metabolite ID and annotation
**** To identify you need to search against public databases:
***** HMDB
***** FooDB
***** METLIN
***** NMR databases
**** Tandem mass spectrometry greatly increases confidence in identification
**** Comparing with authentic standards also helps increase confidence in IDs
*** Contextualization
**** Pathway analysis (limited by how many IDs you were able to get and how well annotated the metabolites are)
**** Next generation pathway analysis includes topological analysis with Metaboanalyst and XCMS spectral pathway analysis
*** Validation 
**** Ion abundances between different compounds are not comparable!
**** Need to validate in an external set with quantitative methodology
** Basics of MS
*** MS schematic
    [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/MS_schematic.png]]
*** Targeted (Quantitative) vs Untargeted (Semi-quantitative)
*** Metabolic profiling/fingerprinting
*** Choosing a metabolomics platform:
    [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/MetabPlatforms.png]]
*** Metabolon, the largest Metabolomics-based company, no longer uses GC-MS, only LC-MS
*** Chromatography is broadly defined as a technique for reducing the complexity of samples
*** Types of chromatography:
**** Liquid
     [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/LiquidChromatographyTypes.png]]
***** Normal Phase (mobile and solid phase are same polarity)
***** Reversed Phase (mobile and solid phase are opposite polarity)
***** Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
***** UHLPC vs HPLC
**** Gas
*** MS relies on gas-phase ionization
*** Ion sources vary
*** Ion suppression is a problem in complex mixtures
*** Different types of chromatograms
    [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/MS_outputs.png]]
*** Ion vs feature vs metabolite
**** An ion is a charged molecule that is represented by a single m/z peak in the data
**** A feature is the collection of ions that are generated by the same parent compound
**** A metabolite is the parent compound
*** Metabolomics dark matter
    | Known known     | Expected to be in your sample, standards are available and experimentally validated |
    | Known unknown   | Suspected or unknown to investigator, documented in databases and literature        |
    | Unknown unknown | Compound previously undocumented, full characterization required                    |
** Basics of NMR
*** Used in many fields outside of metabolomics
*** Based on magnetic properties of certain nuclei (e.g. H1,C13,P31,N15,Si29)
*** Pros/Cons
    | Pros                                                                            | Cons                                            |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
    | Non-destructive                                                                 | Insensitive to compounds with low concentration |
    | Capable of detecting all compounds in complex mixtures                          | Best experiments require 2D approaches          |
    | Less complex sample prep                                                        |                                                 |
    | Very high information content for structural elucidation                        |                                                 |
    | More reproducible                                                               |                                                 |
    | Can do all phases of matter, allowing you to simulated physiological conditions |                                                 |
    | Each atom can be selectively studied                                            |                                                 |

**** Signal area
***** Quantification
*** Sensitivity and resolution depend on instrumentation as well as acquisition/processing parameters
**** Sensitivity is lower noise
**** Resolution is well-separated peaks
**** NMR identification

* Class 3 [2019-01-14 Mon]
** Online Resources
*** Metlin
**** Spectral searching database maintained by UCSD
**** Allows you to specify:
***** Accurate mass
***** Tolerance
***** Ion mode
***** Adduct
*** KEGG
**** Large multiomic pathway database
*** HMDB
**** Exact mass/pathway database. Most comprehensive metabolomics database
*** CFM-ID
**** MS/MS fragmentation prediction tool by the Wishart group that's easy to use
** All about mass
*** Nominal mass: sum of the integer masses of the constituent elements of a molecule (e.g. C=12, H=1)
*** Monoisotopic mass: mass of a molecule given empirical formula calculated using the exact mass of the abundance isotope of each element (e.g C=12.0000, H=1.0078)
*** Average mass: mass of a molecule given empirical formula calculated using the weighted average mass for each element by isotopic abundance (C=12.0112,H=1.00797)
*** Remember when you're looking at MS data, you can only see ions, so you'll have to factor in the weight gained or lost due to the adduct
*** Each fragment will also exhibit a characteristic isotope distribution (i.e. you'll have a number of small peaks representing less common isotopes around the fragment for the most common isotope)
*** Accurate mass is experimentally determined, exact mass is calculated
*** Mass error = (exact mass) - (accurate mass) 
*** Mass uncertainty is measured in ppm or Daltons - you can use the mass uncertainty of your instrument to improve the confidence of your identifications
* Class 4 [2019-01-16 Wed]
** 4 minute metabolomics talks
* Class 5 [2019-01-23 Wed]
** Study design and sampling
*** Sources of variation:
**** Personnel
**** Storage
**** Collection materials
**** Instrument issues
**** Run order
**** Feature extraction
**** Biological
* Class 6 [2019-01-28 Mon]
** Mass Spectrometry
*** Determine chemical formula
*** Determine structural features
*** Workflow
**** HPLC separation
***** Stationary phase (solid)
***** Mobile phase (mix of liquid solvents)
***** Reverse phase is by far the most common separation technique
****** Stationary phase with C8 or C18 chains (nonpolar)
****** Mobile phase of polar molecules like methanol or acetonitrile
****** More polar molecules will elute faster
****** Solvents often get a proton source (usually an acid) to aid in ionization down the road
***** Issues:
****** You generally want your chromatography peak to be symmetrical
****** Your mobile phase is usually a mixture of solvents of variable polarity. The *gradient* of your solvents is what allows compounds in your sample to separate.
****** Sometimes an insufficient gradient results in asymmetric peaks
****** Sometimes your compounds all elute with the "solvent front"
***** 
**** Ionization
***** ESI/nanospray ESI
****** Compunds/solvents are run through a capillary tube with the same charge as the ionization mode
****** Charged solvent drops with compound ions are accelerated through an electromagnetic field
****** The droplets will eventually evaporate, expelling the compound ions, which are sent to the MS
**** Mass Analyzer
***** Cost anywhere between $500,000 and $1.5 million
***** Quadropole
****** Highly sensitive but relatively low mass resolution
****** Mass resolution = (ion mass)/(mass peak width)
****** Mass peak width = Accurate mass +/- (Accurate mass)/(Mass resolution)
****** Isobaric compounds are compounds with the same accurate mass but different structures
****** Mass resolution ~2000
***** TOF
****** Ions are provided in pulses
****** Mass resolution of ~40000
****** Time to reach detector is recorded
****** Maintains isotope distribution
****** The length of the chamber is used to determine time-of-flight, this can be thrown off by such slight things as differences in room temperature causing chamber to expand/shrink
****** Generally used for untargeted analyses
***** Orbitrap
****** Outer and central inner electrodes cause ions to orbit around central electrode
****** Mass resolution maximum 140000
****** However, you need to cut the resolution if you're combining with LC
****** Orbitraps mess with the natural isotope distribution you would expect to see
****** Also generally used for untargeted analyses
***** FT-ICR (Fourier Transform Icon Cyclotron Resonance)
****** Mass resolution 900000
****** Used for extremely difficult ions to tell apart
****** Can't perform liquid chromatography prior to running the sample (runs too slowly to handle LC waves)
**** Detection

** Peak Identification
*** What information can we glean?
**** m/z ratio
**** Retention time
**** Signal intensity
**** Fragmentation
**** Ion Mobility:
***** Ions separate based on:
****** Size
****** Shape
****** Charge
****** This provides orthogonal info that can distinguish stereoisomers
***** Traveling wave ionization (T-wave) is one way of doing this
****** Visualized with collisional cross section
*** Identification criteria (from the Metabolomics Society)
| Identifying Information                                                       | Score                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------|
| At least 2 independent orthogonal identifiers match an authentic identifiers  | 1 - identified               |
| e.g. precursor m/z and product m/z                                            |                              |
| e.g. precursor m/z and retention time                                         |                              |
| Physical chemical properties match literature and public/commercial libraries | 2 - putatively annotated     |
| Physiochemical properties match a known class                                 | 3 - putatively characterized |
| Precursor m/z observed                                                        | 4 - unknown                  |
* Class 9 [2019-02-11 Mon]
** GC/MS
*** Disadvantages
**** Need volatile compounds that can separate in a gaseous phase
**** 30-500 Da
**** Less common than LC/MS
*** GC is separating based off polarity and volatility
*** GC columns can be 30 meters or longer, giving it more resolving power
*** More [[https://teaching.shu.ac.uk/hwb/chemistry/tutorials/chrom/chrom1.htm][theoretical plates]]
*** The main advantage is resolving power
*** You can view fewer metabolites, but they separate much better than in LC
*** More consistent between instruments than LC too (more robust)
*** Tends to break down less, less expensive, easier to use
*** [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/GCvsLCvsNMR.png]]
** Volatile compounds
*** 11,164 different volatile compounds have been IDed in foods alone
*** Span all different types of chemical classes
*** Sample preparation is going to determine what type of compounds you're able to detect
*** No sample prep protocol captures all compounds in a sample
*** Basis of compound isolation
**** Solubility
***** Think about how sample prep affects quantitation. You might not be able to quantify polar compounds if you used a nonpolar solvent because you got a low proportion of the compound from the sample.
***** Aromatics you typically use an organic solvent
**** Volatility
*** Methods of isolating volatility
**** Direct sampling - just inject the sample straight into the machine
***** Won't be very concentrated
***** Need to have a high proportion of volatiles to get a signal
* Class 10 [2019-02-18 Mon]
** Gas Chromatography
*** GC is better at isolating compounds on the basis of volatility
*** Choosing solvents for extraction:
**** Solvents must be highly pure to avoid contaminants
*** Concentration of compounds in solvent (options):
**** Evaporate under a gentle stream of nitrogen - causes loss of volatiles
**** Vigreux fractional distillation - slower
**** Spinning band molecular distillation - expensive and slow but best distiller
*** Volatility:
**** Many factors influence partitioning of compounds into headspace (gas phase), such as solubility or temperature
**** Pass an inert gas through a food and trap volatile compounds
**** Dynamic vs static headspace methods
***** Dynamic is more selective but lower sensitivity
*** Instrumental setup:
**** On column or hot-port injection
**** Capillary columns:
***** Many phases: DB-Wax/DB-5
**** Carrier gas:
***** N2, He, H2
****** N2 and H2 are renewable
****** H2 is the best carrier but safety precautions are needed because its explosive
****** He is most popular at the moment but becoming prohibitively expensive
* Class 11 [2019-02-20 Wed]
** GC columns
*** Tightly wound coils of tube allow you to have much longer columns
*** Resolving power of GC column is defined by:
**** Length of column
**** Flow rate
**** Mixing of compounds
**** Diffusion 
**** Resistance of transfer to mobile phase
**** Viscosity constants
**** Look up what a Van Deemter plot means
**** Column diameter
*** Many times the resolution of the data is sacrificed in order to make the experiment more high throughput
*** The more viscous your carrier gas, the more time substances take to elute
** GC MS
*** Time-of-flight and Orbitrap are more common than quadrupole since they offer greater sensitivity, important in exploratory analysis
*** Ionization:
**** Electron Impact
**** Chemical Ionization
**** Low Energy EI
*** Fragmentation patterns tend to be a lot more consistent in GC since the ionization occurs in a background
** A feature is a data-derived object, a collection of M/Z peaks at a particular retention time
** A feature contains many fragments
** A metabolite can have many features
** Problems arise if you have too many or too few features
* Class 12 [2019-02-25 Mon]
** NMR
*** Quantitative
*** Reproducible
*** Expensive
*** Relatively low sensitivity
** NMR spectrum:
*** Chemical shift is expressed in ppm (hertz normalized for instrument)
*** Chemical shift is not immutable like mass; it depends on solvent, pH, concentration etc.
*** J coupling is the number of active neighboring nonequivalent nuclei (2nl + 1) or n + 1 for 1/2 spin nuclei
**** Number of mini peaks in the larger peak
*** Peak area is proportional to the number of nuclei contributing to the signal
**** Can be used for identification and quantification
*** Look up how to predict 1H NMR splitting patterns again
* Class 13 [2019-02-27 Wed]
* Class 14 [2019-03-04 Mon]
** 2D NMR refers to having 2 dimensions like a carbon dimension and a proton dimension
** This greatly improves identification capacity
** COSY is Hydrogen-Hydrogen 2D (?)
** Transformations:
*** Fourier transform
*** Baseline correction
*** Phase correction
** Chromatogram peak area lets you quantify concentration
** Generally speaking, decoupling is applied to carbon spectra
** Need an internal standard to get absolute concentrations
