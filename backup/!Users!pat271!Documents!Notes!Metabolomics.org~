** Objectives
*** Discuss each part of the metabolomics workflow
*** Relevant to cancer biology and crop science
*** First assignment is to send a primary research article to Jess by Wednesday and present briefly on it on 1/16
** Metabolomics
*** Closest to phenotype
*** Always exerting an effect, unlike genes or transcripts for example
*** Very different between organisms
*** Examples:
**** Amino acids
**** Lipids
**** Sugars
**** Vitamins
**** Phytochemicals
**** Toxins
*** Extremely diverse, especially in plants
**** This is an analytical challenge. We're not looking at a specific set of nucleic acids or amino acids 
*** Highly dynamic
*** No reference metabolome
*** Large differences due to instrumentation platforms
*** Untargeted Metabolomics involves 100s/1000s of metabolites
*** Targeted is more like ~20. Targeted Metabolomics is therefore a bit of an oxymoron
*** Untargeted MS-based metabolomics is always comparative, not quantitative
*** Untargeted and targeted are soft categorizations
*** Uses:
**** Chemical profiling
**** Identify bioitic/abiotic stressors
**** Detect phenotype dependent differences
**** Identify biomarkers
* Class 2 [2019-01-09 Wed]
** Metabolomics workflow
*** Scientific hypothesis
*** Choose samples
**** Need to address the question
**** Eliminate as many confounding variables as possible
**** Examples:
***** Plasma
***** Urine
***** Tissue
***** Biofluids
***** Cells
*** Prepare samples for analysis
**** You can only detect what you present to an instrument for analysis
**** Use a polar solvent when you want to extract polar metabolites and vice versa
**** You can also just dilute a sample to bias your metabolites less, but your samples will be extremely complex
**** If you're doing NMR you have the option to not do sample prep/use solid samples

*** Acquire raw data
**** Three most popular: GC-MS, LC-MS, NMR
**** Data will be retention time and m/z acquired from regular scans
*** Spectral processing
**** Raw spectral data needs to ultimately be turned into a giant table of IDs and abundances per sample
*** Post-acquisition data analysis
**** Significance testing, unsupervised/supervised clustering/machine learning
**** Metaboanalyst is a popular metabolomics interpretation tool
*** Metabolite ID and annotation
**** To identify you need to search against public databases:
***** HMDB
***** FooDB
***** METLIN
***** NMR databases
**** Tandem mass spectrometry greatly increases confidence in identification
**** Comparing with authentic standards also helps increase confidence in IDs
*** Contextualization
**** Pathway analysis (limited by how many IDs you were able to get and how well annotated the metabolites are)
**** Next generation pathway analysis includes topological analysis with Metaboanalyst and XCMS spectral pathway analysis
*** Validation 
**** Ion abundances between different compounds are not comparable!
**** Need to validate in an external set with quantitative methodology
** Basics of MS
*** MS schematic
    [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/MS_schematic.png]]
*** Targeted (Quantitative) vs Untargeted (Semi-quantitative)
*** Metabolic profiling/fingerprinting
*** Choosing a metabolomics platform:
    [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/MetabPlatforms.png]]
*** Metabolon, the largest Metabolomics-based company, no longer uses GC-MS, only LC-MS
*** Chromatography is broadly defined as a technique for reducing the complexity of samples
*** Types of chromatography:
**** Liquid
     [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/LiquidChromatographyTypes.png]]
***** Normal Phase (mobile and solid phase are same polarity)
***** Reversed Phase (mobile and solid phase are opposite polarity)
***** Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
***** UHLPC vs HPLC
**** Gas
*** MS relies on gas-phase ionization
*** Ion sources vary
*** Ion suppression is a problem in complex mixtures
*** Different types of chromatograms
    [[~/Documents/Notes/Images/MS_outputs.png]]
*** Ion vs feature vs metabolite
**** An ion is a charged molecule that is represented by a single m/z peak in the data
**** A feature is the collection of ions that are generated by the same parent compound
**** A metabolite is the parent compound
*** Metabolomics dark matter
    | Known known     | Expected to be in your sample, standards are available and experimentally validated |
    | Known unknown   | Suspected or unknown to investigator, documented in databases and literature        |
    | Unknown unknown | Compound previously undocumented, full characterization required                    |
** Basics of NMR
*** Used in many fields outside of metabolomics
*** Based on magnetic properties of certain nuclei (e.g. H1,C13,P31,N15,Si29)
*** Pros/Cons
