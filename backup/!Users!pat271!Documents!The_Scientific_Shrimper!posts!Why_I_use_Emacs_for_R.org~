* Background
** Like most R users, I was once an Rstudio fan.

   I first started R programming as a freshman at SUNY Geneseo in the
   Biology program. After a semester of learning the basics in an
   introductory ecology course, I dropped the subject for sophomore
   and most of junior year. Without regular instruction, I really
   struggled with gaining basic proficiency. Senior year I made the
   great decision to take my two favorite classes, Biostatistics and
   Modeling Biological Systems. My interest now fully piqued, I
   applied and got accepted to a bioinformatics postbac position at
   the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin
   Diseases, where I looked for ultra-rare genetic variants in a
   cohort of childhood arthritis patients. After a year I got accepted
   into the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program at Ohio State, where
   I work in a metabolomics lab. Now I use R almost every day
