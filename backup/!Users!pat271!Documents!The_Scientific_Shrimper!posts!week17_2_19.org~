#+TITLE: Fantasy Week 17, Part 2

My slim hopes of a Matthews offer sheet were dashed this week, and the news keeps getting bleaker on the Bobrovsky/Panarin front. With Goligoski and Connauton going down for the Coyotes, they're now down to about 50% of their NHL roster. At least I'm not the only one in this league suffering this season.

Last week ended up being a really tight spread for everyone except one person. In short, no one really stood out for how well they did.

** Power Rankings 
1. *Andy* - Strong goaltending gave me a deceptively strong week, even though my scoring was forgettable and my +/- was horrendous
2. *Tim* - Still looking like a beast at #1 in the seasonal ranks, he posted great scoring last week. For once, someone is making more add/drops than me!
3. *Jacob* - Jacob is posting really solid numbers recently, receiving really good goaltending. He's very high in the seasonal rankings too at #5. He could be a dark horse.
4. *Ted* - Also looking good in spite of his lack of participation, mostly due to gaudy scoring.
5. *Kyle* - Been fading but posted a shit ton of penalty minutes last week at least
6. *Lucas* - Poor peripherals counterbalanced by good scoring and goaltending
7. *Zack* - Opposite of Lucas. Crappy scoring and goaltending but good depth stats. You two should totally trade!
8. *Ethan* - Ethan's giving it the old college try but coming up short this season.
9. *Donald* - business as usual
10. *Will* - Pretty shabby this week but doesn't matter when you're playing Chris
11. *Chris* - Also business as usual
12. *Oliver* - Truly terrible week, only above average in ATOI. You need a backup goalie and to stop playing Ehlers. Maybe the Muzzin trade will help.
