#+TITLE: Learning Python
#+AUTHOR: Andrew Patt
#+DESCRIPTION: Since I suck at python but love org-mode, maybe this is the way to finally learn

* Testing
Good news is it looks like I can send individual lines for interactive
eval with C-enter still. Elpy loads when editing chunks but many of
the autocomplete features are unavailable.

#+begin_src python :session
  def foo(bar):
      return bar + 1
foo(1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 2
